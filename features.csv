2018-09-24,--UqJOrThc60bw4ua1bBfQ,Quality food is quality food. It doesn't lie. I would say it has a cute set up but the food is like quality microwaved food.
2015-06-07,TseW_BaZU0wIjnBvrTTe4Q,"My new FAV place!  Most of you would know this restaurant perhaps by Gordon Ramsey's aired episode on Kitchen Nightmares - but NO nightmare here!  Amy's food is AMAZING!  The absolute BEST hummus I have ever eaten!  Everything we ordered was amazing all the way through the desserts!  Everything was so great we bought her cook book!  Besides the great food, Samy and Amy were extremely kind and went out of their way to make it a great experience!  Ladies and gentlemen this is why we don't believe everything we watch on TV!  If you pass by here you need to stop because it is an amazing place!  Thanks Amy and Samy for a great experience!  You definitely have an art and talent!"
2014-12-19,hmoffZbRVAB37kqJVtRA1A,I had a sweet tooth today and as I was checking out restaurants I came crossed Amy's so I went to her website. Their desserts look so good I thought I drive down and pick one up.   The desserts they have look amazing so I bought two pieces of cake which were delicious.   Somewhat expensive but well worth it.    I was with my son and we didn't have time to sit down and eat but he wanted to go back and actually try one of their meals.  The place was absolutely spotless.   A very feminine looking restaurant. The owners were there and were very nice.   One of the reasons I want to go back is because they had an interesting menu and the place was so clean. I'm dying to try a pear salad.   Maybe tomorrow
2010-09-10,OiGyY5vEOBodWrTB7nnnaw,"I have gotten 3 Private messages from Samy asking me to provide a reciept for this meal. I do not like to be bothered by the owner of an establishment telling me I lied. I did in fact eat here, and I didn't like it that much."
2012-12-13,T8LqkYbwMPZmvXSsUfN8sQ,"I went to ABC during the filming of Kitchen Nightmares, so that should tell you something right there. I already knew all about the hoopla surrounding this place and decided it was an experience not to be missed. Plus, I love Gordon Ramsay. The first night of reservations was a cluster-f. I never made it inside and was given a reservation for the following evening instead. In their defense, they had a problem with the POS that seemed to be like a ... nightmare. Ironic, no? We decided to have dinner on the patio next door and watched a very dramatic night unfold at ABC.The second night, we made it in. First off, let me just say that since this dining experience was rather atypical, I felt like some of the other diners were purposely trying to find things wrong with their meal. Aside from the fact that it's awkward to stuff your face with pasta in front of a camera, I tried my best to be impartial.Shortly after we were seated, Gordon eighty-sixed the ravioli for being of the frozen, store bought variety. No surprise there considering the reviews. I had already known to steer clear. I played it safe and ordered the bolognese. It was fine, but nothing to come back for. On the other hand, the pizza and humus were actually pretty darn good. None of us found any reason to complain about the food. In fact, I actually really enjoyed my boyfriend's sweet and spicy pasta rustica. I believe Amy makes the sweet and spicy marmalade cream sauce from scratch. It was quite good, if you like a bit of kick. My table was pretty agreeable until the bill arrived. I think this is where ABC struggles: customer service. If the customer has a problem, for some reason it is not smoothed over. The staff and owners go immediately on the defensive. You literally have to fight to make it right. It seemed very unreasonable to me that we had to point out to them what their menu stated. It didn't matter that we ordered it or double checked when it arrived to make sure that our order was correct. When the bill arrived and it was still incorrect, we were told that we were wrong. We had to point out that they were wrong by using their menu as evidence. Ridiculous.   As we were waiting for the corrected bill, Gordon brought to light some sketchy practices concerning the tip money. It seems the owners are skimming from the waitresses tips. I'm not exactly sure what was going on, but there was an argument where Gordon threw out the term ""slave labor."" Amy then came out to add that the cameras weren't around to see the waitresses when they were just standing around, as if that were a good enough excuse for the tip controversy. A few of the other patrons were pretty surprised and dismayed to find out how little the waitresses were paid. Hopefully, that is something that will be resolved because of the show. I would hate to think I tipped the owner 20% to argue with him over the size of pizza my dining companion ordered. Either way, the customer service and the behavior of the owners was a HUGE turnoff. In conclusion, ABC's biggest problem is customer service. There is none. The waitresses are scared, under-appreciated young girls, just trying to make it through the night. The food, for the most part, is actually pretty good. At least when Gordon is around kicking ass. I can't wait to see how this place is turned around because of the show. Personally, I hope the owners realize you catch a lot more bees with honey."
2011-05-23,cMEtAiW60I5wE_vLfTxoJQ,"Wow - I just read all of the reviews after my visit and am totally shocked.  The owners were nothing but lovely to my friend and I.  We completely enjoyed our Raspberry Champagne cocktails, the caramelized pear salad and our pastas.  The decor is french bistro and I love it, the patisserie case is exquisite and the service was impeccable!  I will definitely be coming back for a repeat visit!"
2014-09-29,6uREWrcg14EdD3UXvmPp0g,"My fiancee and I brought my daughter to Amy's for her 13th birthday upon her request.  We ordered the artichoke and jalapeño dip with the flat bread and it was absolutely AMAZING. We also had pizza and dessert and everything was great.  Amy even came out to wish my daughter a happy birthday.  Don't believe the negative hype,  the food is good!  I think it is really unfortunate that people are bashing them just because of the show, this is their livelihood!  I thought Sammy and Amy were very nice people and the food was very good."
2014-07-11,9XfK_mrVDMRhDsXU5LCaKg,"Tonight was my second visit to ABC. My family and I went there the first time because we were intrigued by the drama on Kitchen Nightmares. We are HUGE fans of Chef Gordon Ramsay and have seen every episode about 5 times.Trip 1 (summer of 2013): After watching the show we psyched ourselves out about how crazy the owners were. We were nervous going into the store and made our plan to go in and look at the desserts, pick something out, and eat it at home. Sammy was in the front and boxed up our desserts and rang us up. He was nice. We could see Amy in the back and anxiously hoped she would make an appearance. Alas, we did not get to meet her. We took our desserts to a friend's house and shared them all with each other. The desserts were great. Trip 2 (tonight): I went to a movie by myself. I kidded with my husband about going to see Amy. We had actually just seen the ABC episode yesterday and had a laugh about it again. After the movie I stopped in. I asked Sammy if he had anything with PB. He smiled and said yes. Amy was also out front. I made a comment that my family was a peanut butter family so that's what I wanted. She made a joke and then started to box it up while Sammy (I apologize if I am spelling his name wrong) rang me up. She asked if I was going right home, because if I wasn't she was going to give me some ice or something to keep it cold. As I was leaving she said she put some extra caramel in the box for me. I still got the jitters throughout the transaction because I kept waiting for something to happen (flashbacks to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld), but they were both nice. I surprised my family with the dessert and we all dug in and agreed it was delicious. As much as I would love to have a cool ""Amy is crazy"" story, I don't. Both trips the owners were kind, the desserts were good, and there was no drama. I don't go to the movies at that location but maybe once or twice a year, but I will probably go to ABC again for a dessert the next time I am over that way. Also, I couldn't do 5 stars yet because I have never eaten a full meal, just the dessert. We talked tonight about trying lunch soon, so I will have to keep you updated."
2014-06-25,TYCkjEHPSJSnFb6m6GDluw,"Solid, perfectly executed, fresh ingredients in some very ecclectic flavor combinations.And the menu warns you about it before you order. And so does your server.BIG WINS:*** spaghetti with meat sauce. served piping hot fresh, fresh oregano, perfectly cooked pasta, delicious gravy.I'm serious about this one. cheesy goodness and just fresh. did I say fresh?*** chocolate cake dessert. so rich, i literally took one bite and i was on overload. boxed for to-go! nice!ECCLECTIC* ""caesar"" salad. more of a cobb/caesar hybrid with lots of cheese, hard-boiled egg, thiinly sliced italian ham and anchovy.  RICH and creamy, and CHEESY! but that's not a Caesar salad.* sweet and spicy sausage pasta. As in candy-sweet from reduced syrup. whoa! that's sweet.* caprese salad. mozzarella very stiff. spinach/greens mix. pesto's vinegar bites like a beast. wow sour!* pizza was not undercooked. fresh ingredients, but not a memory maker.Decor is eccentric as the menu. Strong purposeful choices are part of the fantasy world which is Amy's BC. Electric-powered wall-mounted candelabras (who wants drippy candle wax all over you?!) and ""who's the fairest of them all"" gold-painted-relief mirrors in 2-food cadence on the walls. By the way, there is a drippy-candle-wax display at the end of the dining room. :) Don't miss the diamond-checkerboard parlor tile, a la Alice in Wonderland. Completing the faux fantasy is the music. I can't remember this 90's artist's name, but it's Enigma-like middle-eastern dungeon music. [Edit: *found it*!! The artist is 'Delerium' and I do highly recommend their albums, but it's just a bit heavy while I'm dining... that's just me.]THE RESTOwner/waiter Sammy and his assistants were very friendly and attentive.The other patrons are regulars and one is staring and peering at us to see if she can detect an ulterior motive. We have none."
2013-11-29,xeuQZ3k-jTvr7c91As-chw,"This place is awesome!! Has incredible authentic food! We come here every time we are in Scottsdale!!We went tonight, not having been back in a year. The owner, who comes out to greet you, remembered my wife's favorite dish there... Incredible customer serviceIncredible ownershipIncredible food!!!Really an awesome experience"
2014-08-02,-9yDd38wdN_Z317fCWy_Hg,Omg I don't care what Amy and Sammy says they're both nuts their restaurants filthy I had a piece of cheesecake probably two months old and had mold growing on the top under the raspberries. They think I'm against them and everyone else is but they are totally crazy and they have no business ethics and he should never be in business they should be shut down
2010-08-02,-B-JKktfucShU5bpWX0sDA,"Please don't let one person's grumpy mood ruin an oppoturnity to eat at Amy's Baking Company. What an amazing place!  Amy and Samy always welcome us into their bistro as though we are family! Amy does all the baking herself using her own recipes. I'm addicted to the fig, pear, and prosciutto pizza! I have never tasted pizza crust like this anywhere else! Amy grows her own herbs, heirloom tomatoes and figs. Everything is fresh from her garden--grown, harvested, and baked with the utmost care. The pasta dishes are remarkable!ABC Bistro is also a feast for the eyes. Decorated in European style with Amy's exquisite taste, this restaurant features impeccable white linens under black crystal chandeliers surrounded by flickering candlelight. French pressed coffee is served with beautiful pastries, decorated with edible glitter and flowers.The food and the service are personal and unique. Even on very busy nights, which is most of the time, Samy and Amy drop by our table to chat, suggest Amy's latest creation, or refresh our beverages. On special occasions, we've been treated to ""lagniappe""--a Cajun word meaning ""a little something extra."" So bring your family, your friends, and your good manners! You're in for a special treat!--"
2013-06-09,-BHGiNzxbXKytbocDcJ__A,"My boyfriend and I were heading to Phoenix for the weekend to visit his family, and a few weeks before our trip, we heard about the scandal brewing around Amy's Baking Company. We were very excited to see firsthand if the rumors were true.Despite watching the implosion on Kitchen Nightmares, this place exceeded our expectations. In short, the food was good quality, the desserts were delicious, and there was very little, if any drama as depicted on the show.Food:We ordered a lemon hummus with flatbread appetizer for the table, which was inhaled. We also shared an organic chicken pizza with mushrooms, mozzarella, and basil pesto, and a slice chocolate crème brulee pie. The pizza was delicious and cooked to our liking - the crust was a little on the soft side, but fine - definitely not undercooked. The crème brulee pie also didn't last very long in front of us.Service:This was the one area that might have needed some improvement. Sometimes, it felt like every waiter came to our table. At other times, it was nearly impossible to get somebody's attention (or for them to follow through on a request). The situation seemed a little tense, but without knowing the history of this restaurant, it's something that might have been slightly annoying, but not enough to ruin the overall experience.The staff is likely very new and may not have time to learn how to work well together. Also, when they took our credit card, the check took a while to come back. When our waiter returned, (s)he said that the owner wouldn't allow the server to return the check - and that another server would do it. (Huh?) The server seemed to understand the absurdity of this situation.The Owners:Sammy was very involved in the overall dining experience, checking on waiters. He seemed concerned about making a good impression. We didn't see Amy come out of the kitchen, although we did catch a glimpse of her upon leaving. Sammy was also very happy to take pictures with customers.Overall:A perfectly acceptable dining experience. The food we ordered would have met our expectations for the type of establishment it seeks to be. If the experience is consistent, then there's no reason for the negative publicity.Final Note:We made sure to discreetly ask the servers if they received their tips, which they said they did."
2013-06-06,-KKTrU7vhqSGpkXLCXLd4A,"I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries.  Burger was cooked decent but fries were great.  My friend got a pizza that was very under-cooked and doughy.  Owner came over and asked how things were, I told him the pizza was undercooked.  He took it away, I assumed to cook longer.  After 30 minutes I asked my server what is taking so long. Owner came back and let me know he threw the pizza away and we were not welcome in his restaurant anymore."
2015-04-14,-Kqi9KgYjTRx2CymdFgnOQ,Terrible terrible terrible. Horrendous food and worse service. Never again. I have been to some pretty bad places in my day but this takes it. The restaurant and area are nice and clean however.
2014-11-14,-cv9PPT7IHux7XUc9dOpkg,"Amy and Sammy were super friendly and of course they knew we came because of the show. We came in and had dessert (apple pie and crime brûlée) and fresh French pressed coffee all was delicious. They even took a picture with us, well worth the trip. Don't hate, haters!"
2013-06-22,-gAX3dV1XguaMQAlkhK80g,"Ordered the French Onion Soup - very hot but full of flavor. My dinner companion tried to order bread and butter but was informed by the waitress they didn't have any. They only serve Italian Flat Bread with garlic butter already on it. The owner, Sammy did come out and apologize for the confusion and brought a tiny bit of butter!**Originally posted June 5, 2013**"
2014-08-02,-j6DKVZL4h9wJ5TDESL0Jw,"I travel to the Phoenix metro area fairly regularly, so after seeing Amy's Baking Company featured on ""Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares"", I thought that I'd visit the place and see for myself if the nasty owner and her clueless husband took any of Mr. Ramsey's advice on how to improve their restaurant. I walked into the restaurant at 7pm on a Friday night, and the place was half empty. I ordered the salmon burger with a salad, and although the food wasn't as bad as I was expecting, it definitely wasn't what I would call restaurant quality. I expected the bun to be soggy, but it was actually a bit stale. The salmon was dry and tasteless. The salad was ok, but the oil and vinegar dressing had way too much vinegar. Although the waitress was pleasant, the service was mediocre at best. Because I wanted the waitress and not the owners to get the tip, left a lousy 5% tip on my credit card and asked the waitress to meet me outside after I left so I could give her the remainder of her tip in cash. She agreed, and was extremely thankful. Obviously, in the year and a half since the Kitchen Nightmares episode featuring this restaurant was filmed, the owners have learned absolutely nothing about how to run a restaurant. If this restaurant was located in Northern New Jersey instead of in Scottsdale, Arizona (Where the customers are less discriminating about the quality of the food they eat), it would already be out of business."
2014-09-10,-mpG4UNid6lVXkf4Eobhsg,"Went for the first time today for lunch.  Had reservations based on other reviews and of course TV.  However my coworker and I were in the area and decided to give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised!  The restaurant was slow, only 2 other occupied tables.  We were greeted right away by Samy and told to sit wherever we liked.  We decided to order the Meat the Ball pizza to share.  Samy was very attentive and friendly.   The pizza was really good.  We checked out the dessert display on the way in and everything looked amazing so we ordered the candy bar tart to go.  It too was fantastic!  Only things preventing me from giving 5 stars are as follows:  never took a drink order or offered anything other than water, even though the restaurant was slow, it did take awhile to get our food and then to get the check.  I wouldn't recommend going if you are on a time crunch.  Can't speak as to how criticism is handled as our experience was pleasant and it appeared the other diners were happy as well.  Would definitely visit again if in the area.  They told us they will be revamping their menu in October."
2013-05-08,-nlHAaKCQF5I0GbbwrJo4A,"Was in Arizona to do comedy.  This place isn't far from Stand Up Scottsdale.  I regret setting foot here.  The ownership are horrible people with a rotten attitude. I got a pizza that was clearly reheated and it was downright rotten.  They told me I don't know what real good pizza tastes like.You sons of bitches.  I am from San Francisco.  We've got more good restaurants in a square mile radius than the entire state of Arizona.Stay away from here.  I got a burger from this other place around the block from Stand Up, whom I won't name here."
2013-11-20,-ufevnrV_bwerwAadN_22A,"The desserts are to die for. The pizza isn't the best I've ever had, but it was decent, but the Key Lime Pie...perfecto!"
2015-06-09,0-kSO-iMIy_jecOu2rgHkA,"I have not seen ""the show"" but friends had when they suggested we try this place.  I had of course heard all sorts of things though so I wasn't sure what we were getting into. Luckily things turned out great.  Samy and Amy were very nice to us,  and the desserts were incredible. We were the only ones there that night, and Samy came over to say hi and give us some background about the place and the infamous show. I got the feeling he gives that talk to lots of people. He also shared that he is not in the best of health right now and that he and his wife are the only ones working there. If one of them can't work that day,  they don't open. He also said they will be closing the restaurant for good in mid June and are planning on only selling their desserts wholesale to other restaurants. I'm sorry to see them go."
2013-07-18,06j8uNCin50Q8GaBhmYw-Q,This place is awful. Don't waste your money.
2013-08-27,0EVSxKNh0w9wYIGDx3BwGQ,"After seeing them on TV, I decided to take an hour drive just to taste the food and see if it was as bad as it looked on TV. Realistically, I assumed the food would probably be great and service just as good, but I was wrong. The food was all undercooked and simply didn't taste good. On top of that the service was incredibly slow and you could cut the tension with a knife in that place. It was an awful experience and felt so awkward. I'd never go back again. Terrible food, terrible service."
2012-05-03,0HOQyYFfn8auy34w1nNFjw,"This is really a great place. Nice, quite and the food is really good. I have come there with my children for many years. We have had allot of good memories and family time prior to catching a movie. The owners are engaging and I used that as an opportunity when my kids were small to get them to speak up, order and ask questions. It's next to a harkins movie theater in a very safe area in Scottsdale so we usually go there prior to a movie."
2013-06-19,0LKjg4paFiBG5BOSRk3y2w,"Some amateur cooks try to cover up poor quality ingredients with strong-flavored sauces and toppings. Too many pungent flavors--like garlic aoli, truffle oil, & bleu cheese--piled on an undercooked piece of meat makes for an oily, foul-tasting mess. Same goes for pizza with pulled pork, BBQ sauce and apples--too many sweet, cloying flavors with no contrast. Repeated complaints about undercooked food indicate the food (including the pizza) is frozen and not thawed properly. On the menu, the phrase ""freshly sauteed chicken breast"" is repeated three times, so the chicken is probably pre-cooked and frozen. Many of the sauces are overly sweet with the main ingredient of preserved fruit that came out of a jar. ABC claims to be vegetarian friendly, but doesn't make substitutions because nothing is cooked to order. A lot of the food resembles cafeteria slop because the cook has no sense of proportion or balance and all the ingredients are canned or frozen. The prices are ridiculous for industrial strength food, as is charging extra for parmesan cheese, bread, or drink refills. Next they'll be charging customers for napkins and forks. Five stars in response to all the rave reviews written by ""elite"" Yelpers who were most certainly not paid. ;)  And Amy bakes all those cakes from scratch."
2014-04-28,0Obv11hIy0NHLCle8NAdiw,"We live in Queen Creek about 45 minutes from ABC.  My brother, from New Orleans, was visiting his daughter and grandchildren in Tempe, so we decided to try ABC for lunch on April 19th.  I will admit that we tried ABC because of all the publicity.We arrived a few minutes before they open (12 noon).  Sammy was cleaning and rinsing the patio.  He came over and opened the door allowing us to enter early.  The interior is beautiful.  Sammy waited on us.  There were additional wait staff, but Sammy was our waiter.  We started with garlic flat bread.  A great way to start the meal and continue eating it through the meal.  I took some home for later!My wife had the ""Pear Salad"".  The greens looked and according to my wife were very fresh.  The salad contained crispy, tasty pieces of pear.  She was unable to eat the whole salad.My brother had the Spinach Ravioli.  He chowed down the entire plate.  When I told him they were not fresh raviolis, he said, ""so... the taste is what counts and I enjoyed them.""  I cannot argue with that logic.I had the Sweet and Spicy Pasta Arustica (sp?).  The flavors were a little different, first a little sweetness, then a few moments later, a little spice kick. The dish matched the description.  I ate most of mine, finishing up as a snack that night.We each agreed that our meals were very good and would order them again.Rarely, do we get dessert when we go out to eat.  However, the presentation case was so inviting that we picked dessert to go.  My wife chose the White Chocolate Coconut Cream Tart while I picked the Chocolate/Caramel Tart.  These were wonderful.  They were so decadent that we could only eat a couple of bites at a time.  They lasted several days.Sammy was a gracious host and waiter!There was no drama while we were there, nor was their any reason for any drama.When we are in the Scottsdale area, we will return to ABC.FYI: The menu on the web site is out of date.  ABC no longer serves burgers.  They need to update their web page and remove them."
2015-03-12,0b2gWnSprTlJttji_QyitQ,The worst food I ever had in my life. There where yell and swearing in the place in front of the kids. Sammy the worst person except his wife. The food took to long and tasted like crap. No wonder why the great Ramsey would not give this place and time and effort. What a waste. DONT GO!!!
2014-09-12,0xVjQRs4sd_LiZ8fQUoP5Q,"I visited, out of curiosity. While I didn't witness any theatrics and I didn't experience any adverse service, I found the food, lackluster. Seasoning was non existent and grease was plentiful. The pizza my fiance ordered, while crisp and cooked thoroughly, was bland and uneventful. I didn't care to order dessert. Thank you for being friendly and welcoming, but I wouldn't recommend the food. Three stars for service."
2015-04-15,10BXiJcHOpD--DxShu-o3w,I went there yesterday during business hours only to find the place closed. Highly doubt I will take the time to try again another day.
2013-06-21,1385b8veIRtj418CbIaRfg,"My husband and I visited Amy's this past Wednesday for a going away dinner for our friend Angela.  She chose Amy's because she wanted to see what the hype was all about before leaving town.  When she told us that's where dinner was going to be I didn't want to go, just because I've heard the stories...although never seen the infamous episode.  I was scarred...It was a great experience from the moment we walked in and were seated.  My husband ordered the prickly pear margarita, which he said was excellent.  For our appetizer, we ordered the artichoke dip.  Although it was cold, which I'm not used to, it was delish.  The bread it came with was also fabulous.  For our entrees, we had the spinach tomato ravioli, fig pear pizza and Italiano pizza.  I thought the ravioli was great and everyone else was raving about the pizza.  My husband said it was among the best he's had.  Now for dessert, can I just say it was die to for.  We had this white chocolate coconut cream pie and a gluten free chocolate mousse.  Wow!  They were both incredibly decadent.We even had a long and pleasant conversation with Sammy.  He was very nice and forthcoming with the bad publicity they've received and genuinely seemed determined to move past it, which cannot be an easy thing to do.  We only caught a couple glimpses of Amy, who was busy working away in the back but we did ask to get a photo with Sammy and he happily obliged.  We had to get proof of our visit lol!  Will definitely be back!"
2014-06-19,1iphqkZxhQum2bNeWho9-w,"Yikes!!! I must be honest, I went in thinking the TV show embellished the crazy that's in this place. I was wrong!!! Had a pizza, it was undercooked, just asked if it could be cooked a little longer and got yelled at. Was told to leave but not before I paid for food I didn't even take a bite of!! Do not go here, do not feed these people egos! I can't believe they are still open! Hoping karma will work quickly for Amy's bakery!"
2014-10-11,1m1faPvJEjJmqvip8Dxx_Q,"This was my first time back in quite a while. We stopped in to get some deserts to go. My friend and our children enjoyed looking at the amazing items in their pastry counter. Although they are pricey, their deserts are all made in house and are stunning. Samy was very friendly and helpful as well as patient with our 5 children. When we got home we split a variety of items with our families: Key Lime Pie, GIANT chocolate dipped macaroon, eclair, flourless chocolate cake and the individual chocolate covered pumpkin cheesecake. Am I forgetting anything? They were all amazing and we really enjoyed the tasting we had. Each one tasted as good as it looked!"
2013-07-22,1nbCL_vfZLG-AgHHuQxfKA,Two friends and I went by to see what all the fuss was about.  None of us have any opinion on the food due to waiting over 70 minutes for our appetizers.  We simply left.  The water was good I guess.
2014-06-18,1zgZEV-Dqf3x071ZUeBr_g,We went here because of the show so I wasn't sure what to expect but as others have shared I was pleasantly surprised. Both my husband and I had the spinach mushroom raviolis and my son had meat sauce penne. We all ate until our plates were clean. We had dessert to and it was very good especially the chocolate cake! Both Sammy and Amy were nice we got a group picture. The employee was also very attentive and kind too.
2013-05-31,25rA1ch8rc8okQZBTKHW5A,"Over priced drinks, under cooked food, and the longest wait time I've ever sat through. There's a lot of restaurants on Shea, don't waste your money here."
2014-10-01,27tXlCbrw4iwcpF9nZc9vw,Great experience.  Very clean and health department inspection on front door displayed.  I was greeted by staff prior to open and we talked about the pastry.  I met the owners who were very nice business owners and were interested and focused on my questions.  I purchased a honey apple cake...not a slice but a whole cake.   Took it home opened up the lid ... Amy left a very sweet note on the lid.   Now.... I was raised on honey cake....and this is incredible!  I latter called to thank both owners on my experience.
2015-05-16,29TQpZvm6C9BEsnYqr_pYA,"BEST salad I have had in a very long time!!  I had the spicy peanut salad with grilled chicken. The dressing is freshly made and is wonderful. We also tried the chocolate raspberry mousse cake.  To die for!!!  We had amazing, personalized service, calming, lovely atmosphere.  I broke my 60 day diet and it was so worth it!!  I would love to come back!!"
2013-06-05,2Ijwl4mLaTdjvY8yUex8YQ,"I went in open minded and I was in a good mood. Boy did that change quickly. After I got my pizza, like the show, Kitchen Nightmares, it was very doughy and tasted like dog crap. I told Samy, and even pulled apart the pizza in half, and he could see the dough being very Silly Puddy-like. Shockingly, he cursed me out and told me I was an imbecile and apparently I have no idea how a pizza should taste. I wanted dessert too but no, I was told to get the f*ck out. This is by far the worst restaurant experience I've had in my life. I went back in to take a leak and after I come out of the bathroom Amy is waiting for me and yells in my face, ""WHAT THE F*CK IS WRONG WITH YOU, F*CKING LEAVE YOU INTERNET BULLY."" This woman is completely out of her mind, and absolutely delusional. She'll try to argue black is white. It's crazy. I told her to chill out and I'll leave at my own pace. She kept screaming four letter words and this and that, grabbed a broom and chased me out. Her exact words were ""You better get the f*ck out before I shove this broomstick up your ass."" Un-freakin-believable. She said I was disrespecting her and disrupting her business. She is the spawn of the devil and should be in an institution. I don't know how her business is still running."
2014-05-08,2JuXqrRsB1KEDOWZwHRUyQ,Are you kidding me? I love this place... The desserts are amazing...Staff was cool and Amy was a non-event...Keep it up and don;t let them get you down... Cheers From Seattle
2014-06-04,2NzVYyUMEi8YFaPfUd6OFg,"We stopped by on our way back home to Los Angeles from Tuscon back in October of 2013. I am now just getting around writing my review after Kitchen Nightmare's new episode on this establishment reminded me of the frenzy over this restaurant. First off, please do not be fooled by the many many fake reviews on here, lots of people apparently find it funny to just write whatever Chef Ramsay had pointed out on national tv in the first episode. This poor behavior from fellow reviewers also prompted me to say my 2 cents which had actual credence considering I've been there! Their food is actually really good. Their hummus and Gnocchi were phenomenal. It's silly to think that their food would be of actual horrible quality, the restaurant itself is immaculate and clean, but I wanted to decide for myself and I am so glad I have done so. Sammy was our ""waiter"" he was constantly followed by two girls who seemed a little lost. He is, to be fair, exactly like he is portrayed on the show. He talks a mile a minute, assures you everything on the menu is SO good and so on... My boyfriend told him of our family restaurant in Los Angeles to which Sammy proudly responded that HE is planning to come to Los Angeles to open a new restaurant (.... Bit of an exaggeration I'm sure, but fuck, I'm down to go!) so they are somewhat milking their instant celebrity and I don't blame them but they are quite the characters. Sadly Amy came out of the kitchen only once, she looks much skinnier in real life. Also, be on the lookout for the cat statue above the desert fridge  - meow meow."
2014-05-26,2RDGfg3kMn3OcIw_YwLJ-A,What we saw were 2 owners in a fight to save their business. The food is amazing. The gnocchi is outstanding with lots of variety. The desert is delicious. Even after the kitchen was closed and we were finninshing up Sammy was still welcoming people in and making coffee and tea drinks.
2013-05-23,2SW0GXcPc2eTfykYfZNeBQ,"Yes, I actually went there last night as part of their grand re-opening.  I have to admit, although I've been to Pita Jungle and Gelato Spot (next door) a lot, I've never even noticed this place before much less eaten there.  Yes...I got caught up in the whole Kitchen Nightmares drama and figured I'd give it a shot to see what all the drama is about.Our reservation was for 8:45 and we got there a few minutes early.  Someone (I suppose, but don't know, from the PR firm) met us at the door and asked if we had a reservation.  Once confirmed we were promptly seated.  Probably another 20 people or so there at the time.  There was no crazy ""scene"" going on, no cameras rolling, no waiver to sign, etc.  Except for people strolling by the outside to look inside all seemed ""normal"".As other reviewers have noted, I think the serving staff were all new.  They seemed to be trying hard to please and - understandable given they were all (presumably) new, there was a little confusion (several servers came by initially asking us the same questions), but it wasn't too bad and, as I said, understandable given their situation.  I think it'd be unfair to be too harsh on the service at this stage in their ""re-building"".  Also, it's hard to say if the high level of attentiveness will remain as things cool down, so time will tell...A preface on the food comments, I'm not a food critic - so my palette may not pick up what others may notice.  That being said, I do know ""good"" food from ""bad"" food (I think).To start we ordered the olive tapenade and one of the meatballs.  Both arrived within 10 minutes and both were adequate, not memorable either way.  The olive tapenade came with a lot of bread which was good.  For entrees we ordered the fig pear prosciutto pizza and the tomato basil gnocchi.  The entrees came out 15-20 minutes after ordering.  The pizza was fine - cooked ok and tasty, no problems there.  As others have mentioned the gnocchi came with a lot of sauce, but the sauce was good as was the gnocchi.  Again, all adequate to good, but nothing super memorable.We didn't try the desserts but they all looked great and based on other reviews are probably good.  If they make them on premises its impressive, but others seem to think (maybe for good reason) they don't - which if they don't they shouldn't say they make them in house as some people really care about that.  Me...I just want my desserts to taste good, I don't really care where they're from as long as I'm being treated honestly.Sami never came by but he was circulating quietly around.  He did input our orders rather than the server - doesn't seem efficient and could cause errors, but I guess that's their business.We left a tip and hopefully (because its the right and legal thing to do) this went to our server.  I didn't ask the server because I think they've probably heard that question before (probably a lot) and it's not like this issue need my attention at this point.All in all, just ok.  Two stars would seem punitive and it doesn't merit 4 stars in my opinion.  Would I be back?  Probably not as there are so many great restaurants around.  But, based on this experience would I tell others to avoid it?  Probably not either.There's not much to see here folks.  My hope for them is they treat their customers and employees with respect and have learned something from this experience."
2013-05-23,2gu5B_JbJlfZLhihSr-apQ,"I kept waffling between 2 and 3 stars, but then I realized that, no, things were not A-Ok (the 3 star rating) but Meh. I've experienced better (the 2 star rating) fit mostly where the food was concerned.First and foremost I was hesitant to even write a review.  Could I be impartial and simply review the food and service, leave all the negativity that has been swirling around this place and the owner considering I was in fine dining for years?  Also I am a small business owner and was appalled by their behavior to customers and employees and was a bit embarrassed to even be giving them my business.  On a lark I sent in a reservation request to their Grand Reopening and was very surprised when I got an email saying I was in.  But I thought long and hard and decided yes I can and here it goes.The food was ok, not horrible, not great, but there were execution problems that need to be addressed.  First we got the cilantro hummus and the herbed flat bread. The flavor was good, bread was cooked well, no issues here.  Second we ordered the French Onion soup, my favorite soup in the world.  The portion size was great, the flavor of the broth was spot on but there was hardly any cheese melted on the top.  I like to get a huge chewy mouthful of cheesy goodness and I didn't because I couldn't, not enough cheese!  Also there was barely any onions in it!  Broth and bread basically made up this soup.  Also it was so hot it scalded both myself and my fiancé.  I know, soup should be hot, but this was way too hot.I ordered for my main course the spinach and ricotta ravioli with basil pesto, bacon and mushrooms.  I was shocked when it came out in a shallow bowl and looked like soup.  The whole thing was literally swimming in the sauce.  The sauce itself actually tasted quite good, but since it overpowered everything else in the bowl it made for a lackluster experience.  I couldn't even taste the spinach and ricotta raviolis, such delicate flavors that didn't even have a chance.  The mushrooms would have been lovely if there were a bit more of them and not cut so paper thin.  The bacon and wilted spinach on top would have been another great flavor level but again, you couldn't really get your mouth to taste them.  We also ordered the gnocchi with tomato basil, exact same problem as the raviolis, it was a soup!  The gnocchi were actually perfectly cooked and pillowy.  Both the pasta dishes could have been great but fell flat.My fiancé ordered one of the burgers, I was pretty full and didn't get a chance to try it but he said it was pretty good but the outside was charred.  I thought the price tag of $14 was a bit much, especially since it didn't come with fries.Last we had the creme brûlée, it was perfect, but I don't know how you could mess that up.  The dessert case itself looked very inviting and if I wasn't full I would have opted to try a few more items.On to the wait staff, everyone was brand new and while they were very friendly and efficient, none of them had tasted anything on the menu.  This is appalling to me, how are they suppose to give recommendations if they don't even know what any of the food tastes like?  There was no craziness going on, the mood was actually quite subdued, Samy was going up to tables talking to customers, but didn't stop by ours.  The place wasn't busy at all, but I guess they wanted the Grand Reopening to be not so hectic.  Also the timing on our food wasn't bad, we waited about 30 minutes after our appetizers to get our main courses.  I said this would be the one and only time I go there but I think I might go back in a month or two, just to see if things have changed.  Of course I will be keeping up on the going ons over there.  Maybe they have learned from their mistakes, who knows, only time will tell."
2015-03-12,2nW7zmBil4aP4WdCpSjrjQ,"These 4 and 5 star reviews must be made up , I stopped in while visiting relatives and the food took forever and was not worth the wait. Stay clear and do not believe these fake positive reviews."
2014-05-22,2q5IY-sQEUfUwjvABCeuog,"Loved their food! We ordered a variety of pizzas and desserts. They were VERY GOOD!! Samy was a very attentive waiter and he was super respectful. Also, AMY WAS VERY SWEET. We had not seen the show before going there but watched it after our visit and they were nothing like the show made them seem. In fact, we felt bad when we watched the show bc who wouldn't be crazy angry if they were being targeted and told their not good enough? Anyways, I WILL BE GOING BACK. EVEN BROUGHT DESSERT HOME FOR MY BOYFRIEND!! Don't believe everything you see on reality tv."
2014-04-09,3WL_xM2yl7uPFnCxIphaQg,"When I visit my daughter last summer, we had came and had dinner, I can tell you all I received was Excellent food, Excellent  service and was very welcomed, you guys are one of the best places to eat, and Definitely  will be back next time I am in town. As far as the people who have never visited Amy's dont leave a review untill you visit a place other wise what you say means nothing.  LOVE THE FOOD AND SERVICE"
2014-05-06,3_oOvKDxkASn51PBn2ZI_g,"The food is atrocious, the owners have no idea how to run a restaurant! AVOID THIS PLACE!"
2014-01-25,3cjKxW24NsgDAoFQSUC68g,"I was visiting family in the area a few weeks ago (from Chicago) and made sure that they took me here, admittedly out of curiosity after seeing ABC on Kitchen Nightmares.  We stopped by to pick up dessert to go, picking out the candy bar torte and key lime pie.  Sami greeted us right away and chatted for a bit and seemed perfectly pleasant, at least towards us anyway.  He was actually the one who brought up tv and Gordon Ramsay, out of nowhere, as I was trying to play it cool...not sure if he was just being honest and up front or just proud of the publicity and attention (even if it has been largely negative).  We didn't talk to Amy, but I did see her through the kitchen door and her touch was evident throughout the dessert case with the little chocolate ""Meow!"" tags topping many of the desserts.In regards to the desserts themselves, they were good, but not necessarily amazing.  And I am glad I love glitter, considering that their dessert case has more (edible) glitter than a gay pride parade.  All in all, I'm glad I got the chance to stop by and I'd be willing to give it another shot, this time to have an opportunity to dine in and eat an actual meal (Sami recommends the pizza!), not just dessert."
2013-05-22,3ftiYxTwV7MIiPMr_Ogifg,"I was informed by email that a reservation was being held for me... and I had to confirm in one day whether I would accept it.The reservation was for 9:15. The restaraunt closes at 10:00.They were giving me 45 minutes to arrive, be seated, order, eat, pay, and leave.It wasn't possible.I was just going to do a dessert and coffee, but no one wanted to go with me, and the reservations were for two people.Out of all my friends, family and acquaintances, no one wanted to go. Not even if I paid them to eat the food.I think that last bit is worth noting."
2013-08-11,3mfOGv0puI7a4dU_iRXYxg,"horrible food, obviously horrible service.  I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone in arizona or vising az."
2013-05-31,3rUIIJKg252wse9UjXth_g,"This place is horrible. The food is mediocre at best, and the atmosphere is miserable. Let's not even get started with the old-timer running the place."
2013-07-12,3wvz86hC8FLUVBRK9X0tKA,"Really really bad food...went there last weekend. Owner sammy is cool, not too sure about his wife who looked scary. I had already known she couldnt take any criticism so sending my food back was out of the question. go somewhere else"
2015-04-25,4KhzlD8bt54p5afAPiiTiw,"I had the super food salad with beets and goat cheese. It was delicious and plentiful. The pea and ham soup was flavorful, thinner than I typically like, very tasty. The owner was very attentive and gracious. I'll be back. Okay, I had dessert too. Caramel nut tarte with chocolate ganache. It was really good, not too sweet. The portions were very large, they would have easily served two."
2014-11-26,4bXyi_RFEgpZyuqwFOrw1Q,My wife and I stopped into Amy's last night for a birthday dessert right before they closed.  Samy welcomed us in and went the extra effort to even add a birthday candle to the chocolate mousse cake.  The dessert was amazing!!  We loved it!  Samy and the staff were incredibly friendly.  All in all a great ending to my birthday.  We would definitely go back.
2014-11-09,4s6_4dxJKpwkEnnKIKsaGA,This restaurant is dreadful. The staff has zero respect for the opinions of their customers. I hope this place goes out of business. Horrible food and even worse management. No one should ever go here.
2013-05-30,4vpZToBSrgo1yb48u9OGUg,"After seeing the Kitchen Nightmares episode and an up coming trip to visit friends out in Arizona, I put two and two together and decided to go check it out. Just to see what it's like. Why not? I'm in the area. I wanted to see what all the drama was about. And it was after the ""grand re-opening"". The place is spotlessly clean, I mean you could eat off the floors. I was actually impressed how clean it was. And empty. Quietly empty. I guess it was because it was lunch, but it was still unnerving. After being seated the nice middle aged women got us our drinks and took our order. She seemed really nervous and scared, and after seeing the notorious Sammy watching her like a hawk, I can see why. After this, all the issues began.We got the expected long wait to get our food. I wasn't in any hurry, but at least it got to me before I starved to death. I ordered a pizza, my friend got a hamburger. My pizza was okay, the crust was a little hard, but it was good. My friends hamburger/slider was rarer that she said she wanted, but ate it anyway. It was okay, passable at the best. Since both of us thought that the meal wasn't that bad, we decided to order the ""famous"" deserts. I ordered a Key lime pie slice and my friend got some chocolate cake. Sammy brought the slices over to us and I noticed something odd. There were fruit flies. On the top of my key lime pie. Let me repeat that. Fruit flies. On top of my pie. Two of them. Just chilling there. I called Sammy back over and asked what was up with these little bugs in my cake and he went off about there being a bug problem and how someone was bringing them in to sabotage them or something. He also said it better not me me or my friend or he'd throw us both out. No comp, no new pie slice, nothing. I had to eat the price of my bug pie. Because he thought I put it there. We paid our overly expensive bill and left as quickly as possible. The experience wasn't as bad as what we saw on Tv, but I've still never been treated like that, as a customer, in my life. One star for a clean bathroom, cute decore and a clean place to sit. I guess."
2014-11-14,4xKdgkAeI0pPTR4rKP7TaQ,"I went to Amy's Baking Company with my parents and boyfriend yesterday afternoon. We was AMAZED. Samy was a great host and Amy was kind enough to come out and meet us. We were welcomed into the restaurant as intimately as if it had been their home. The restaurant was beautiful. Drippy candles, family photos, classic decor, and Enya playing on the stereo- contributing to the ethereal atmosphere. My mom mentioned ""if I had my own restaurant, I'd want it to look and feel JUST like this."" The food was exquisite, yet simple. We all enjoyed salads and two appetizers: the hummus and flatbread, and the artichoke dip with flatbread.The service was also impeccable, warm and inviting. The dessert we got was a gluten-free chocolate mouse cake. DELICIOUS. This restaurant is wonderful and deserves a much higher rating than it currently holds. The Scottsdale community should support this business and anyone from out of town needs to come check it out and decide their OWN opinion and not allow social media to decide for them. This restaurant has been misrepresented. A lot of care goes into the food and ambiance. Give ABC a chance!!!"
2013-05-22,5GhMYrgTUOeu9ycpAkr8Tw,This place sucks. It's way overpriced and the way the owners act is EXACTLY how the acted on tv. Very dysfunctional. I went there a year ago and was disgusted by their behavior. The food is mediocre at best. Just do yourself a favor and don't eat here. I wasn't surprised at all to learn they use store bought raviolis and steal their employee's tips.
2013-09-16,5Wr4pwoIaqyTDNsyY0j8BQ,NEVER go here! it's just as bad as people say it is and as bad as it's portrayed on kitchen nightmares! the food is poorly made and just disgusting to even look at.
2013-10-11,5g5BjhARiZ4zw0SthMH0OQ,"Yup, we gave in to the hype and went to Amy's!  Glad we did, too!  We were in the area and decided to try it out for dessert.  We walked in and it was empty...I think they had just opened up.  It's a very cute place!  Samy greeted us and was very kind...I was a bit nervous (because of all of the hype) to tell him that we were just there for dessert.  He quickly showed us all of the desserts in the case.  It was hard to decide.  I went with the Chocolate Caramel Tart and my best friend went for the flourless German Chocolate cake.  We chose to stay and eat and Samy showed us to our table and brought us some ice waters.  Amy came out to look at the desserts and told us both hello with a smile.Samy brought us our desserts and they were DELICIOUS.  They were both VERY rich in flavor...the kind of rich where you know you are not going to be able to finish it.  So we took more than half of it home...which I can't wait to revisit again later! After looking at the menu, the best friend and I decided that we will definitely be going back to try some of the pizza and pasta dishes they have to offer. Both Samy and Amy were very kind.  I am a very honest and loyal Yelper, so I hope those of you who read this, see that and take this review for what it is.  A true representation of the visit to ABC that my best friend and I experienced on a lovely Friday afternoon.As we left, Amy thanked us, as did Samy and we were off!I admit, I did follow all of the drama, but I am the type that needs to judge things for myself...and this was one of those places that I am glad I chose to visit and see what I would experience!"
2015-06-26,62h3Yi8DTlyLZlJTi4SzvA,Just came in for a dessert and it was fantastic! I would definitely come back again. Amy is a very talented baker. Very impressed. They were very friendly and I really enjoyed it.
2013-08-01,6LL5FIVof3Q7Y-UwLunonA,"This place was on Kitchen Nightmares.  That should say enough about the food.  However, I do think it's worth mentioning that I went there a few months ago, and after waiting for 45 minutes for a salmon burger I got fed up and decided to leave.  Sammy, however, said I couldn't until I paid for the bill.  The only think I'd received was a glass of water.  Of course, I didn't pay for the food I never received.  The nerve of that guy to even think of trying to pay for the food I didn't get, sheesh."
2011-08-30,6OfAMAEs1bvcsF-oq6DhNA,"Visiting some friends in AZ and we decided to pull over and grab some food. We initially stopped to grab some gelato but upon deciding we were hungrier thought we would grab a bite and get some gelato for after. Torn between the pita place and Amy's Baking Company I won the vote to head into Amy's. Sometimes winning the vote is not a good thing.Moment we stepped inside the service was instantly poor. sat ourselves down and waited and waited til we got some menu's. Then waited and waited for them to take a drinks order. Normally I wouldn't be as fussy but AZ is freaking hot so i need my fluids man!I ordered the Margarita pizza as i love pizza and like to try it in as many different places i can. This unfortunately was a let down. My wife didnt even finish her meal of Insalata Caprese salad due to its unfresh taste.Very underwhelming overall experience and simple things like good service, refills, even bread to chew on while you wait for your meal (which also took a ridiculously long time to make its way to us after waiting ages to give our order) were overlooked (charge extra for bread! come on!)If I was local i wouldn't frequent this place and next time my vote will go to pita jungle!"
2014-03-06,6Rk3eGlEzoIkLVxrZzIr9g,"Absolute trash food and mean people on the staff. DO NOT COME HERE. If you ever come around this area do not come here because all you will receive is abuse. The owners are terrible people, not to mention they are just arrogant and think their terrible food is the best around? I think not. Stop by taco bell for better food and service."
2015-05-15,6WYPtBdVh8Iwt96RBGpmSg,"I've seen the show, I know what happened, but since moving back to Phoenix, I wanted to see this place and give it a shot. They recently changed their menu so this pizza-heavy menu you see here on yelp is incorrect. They went to a very light, healthy selection. Great decision given the other shops adjacent to them (fish tacos, greek, pizza). I tried the Sweet & Spicy Asian Peanut Salad. It's just as the name suggests. Amy's peanut sauce is delicious and together with all the other flavors (mint, cilantro, arugula, onions, peppers, peanuts), it's incredible. Even without the chicken, it's a healthy portion for $10. I don't think it's necessary to speak on their personalities, but since that seems to be a hot topic here, I'll just let it be known that I was treated very kindly. Samy asked if I would like some water as I waited for my to-go order and both were very polite.I'll definitely be back and hopefully next time I can convince myself to go all out and get one of Amy's delicious looking cakes and pastries. They were beautiful, but I'm trying to watch my figure (Jack Black reference)."
2016-07-15,6ZYLEwzTp-BUN7y8pKalcw,Amy Bouzaglo who's real name is Amanda Patrica Bouzaglo has potential for bellvue mental hospital her and that so called samy Iranian husband of hers are better off to go to work for McDonalds to learn how to cook. here's a message for Amanda or so called Amy there is a little thing called a leash law put your leash on whenever you go out
2013-06-08,6a0fCioxPbwrgkzwS1C9-A,"I ate here a few years back and I'll tell you, this is a place you do not want to take your children to. The language and attitudes was horrible. There were 5 of us, 4 adults and 1 child ( age 13 ) and I would not recommend this to anyone with minors.  The pizza was horrible. Under cooked dough, but over all good toppings choice, the Penni was horrible and the so called lemon sauce or what ever it was..canned/frozen or from a jar, reminded me of marmalade. We had crunchies in our food that didn't belong and my burger, let's just say it was just as bad as seen on TV, I have no clue what was oozing from it like a waterfall.Our waitress was very friendly and kind and took good care of us but the man behind the counter stared in a weird kind of way making us feel uncomfortable. The overall appearance of the place was well kept and the dessert display was an excellent eye candy but taste, let's just say it was very over priced for what you got and I had a nat in my pie that the waitress took back and the owner refused to remove from my tab.Overall, the place is clean with friendly staff, the owners are horrible and the food is extremely overpriced for what it is. This is not a steak house or fine restaurant, I'm sure they would like it to be and the prices gouge you.I will not stop there again and would recommend others to do there research before wasting there time or money for a second rate restaurant with horrible second rate food and losers for owners.Consumer beware"
2014-10-05,6bSCCD5p6Hb7uSSx2yPaig,"Just had a great meal at Amy's from the new menu.  It was delicious!!!  Fresh, unique, and healthy!  We had the artichoke with flatbread appetizer, the pear salad, and the walnut chicken salad sandwich.   We loved all three dishes.  Our waitress was a sweetie too, very attentive.   We will definitely be back.  We highly recommend this restaurant."
2010-08-14,6jJSCNe91scG9Nrn2u0oNA,"I had read all the stink around the bad review and  bad rebuttal and was in the area and hungry early evening @5:00pm on a weekday so I decided to go in and grab a light dinner and see for myself about the quality of food and service and without question it was so much better than was reported by the previous reviewer I had to make sure I was in the right place (I was). I ordered a curious dish of deviled salad with smoked salmon on toast points and my date ordered a Ceasar salad and we each ordered a glass of champagne just because. Both of our meals were wonderful as was the house champagne (med-dry with a fruitiness). We split what we both agreed was the best Tiramisu on the planet and cup of coffee (also excellent). The waitress was efficient, friendly and well informed. The owner (male) was very cordial, came to our table 3 times during our meal to check on us and we met the other owner (female) on the way out and she was very friendly.I will be back....just shows you to make your own decisions!"
2013-09-03,6tqYrQj2hIEt1-L-G6j4uQ,"Never eat here! I came into town and someone pointed it out. I always read reviews but this time I didn't have time to. Their food is terrible, the pasta was disgusting and the pizza was bad. Not only was the food a problem, the owners are very mean and they disrespect their customers. I've never in my life seen anything like this."
2013-05-27,6yVgT6wNHaFnM_O8LLPb7A,Brilliant food and service.  Waitress said she got to keep her tips.  That part was all thrown in to make the owners look bad.  Awesome desserts.  Shame there are so many fake reviews on this business.  Guess Yelps filters dont really work very well.
2013-05-26,7-bGErnDfMVPe1VYH04yqQ,"I had never seen Restaurant Nightmares before [edit 5/27: Kitchen* Nightmares- hah, proves my point], and it was purely by chance that I stopped on the ABC episode when I was flipping through channels one night. What made me give it a shot? Pretty much the same thing that caught everyone else's attention and made this episode so good- the draahmah! I had missed the first few minutes, and I didn't realize where ABC was located. When I found out? Well, my reaction was kind of like this: OHH SHIT. WE'RE GONNA BE IN SCOTTSDALE IN TWO WEEKS. Hmm, let's maybe...probably...definitely investigate this place for ourselves. I was so intrigued. I couldn't help it. It's was like dangling a squeaky toy in front of a puppy. So on Friday, May 24th at 9pm, after discovering that it was located only two miles away from our hotel, I talked Hubs into going there for dinner. He had never seen the episode- or even heard of Restaurant [Kitchen*] Nightmares- so he had no idea what I was about to potentially get him into.We pulled into the packed shopping center, and I immediately assumed that the cars belonged to the masses and the media swarming the place. OH NOOO, I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET IN. When we drove by the front of the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see (the front is all windows) that there were quite a few tables open. Guess the cars belonged to the movie-goers next door. After being influenced by the show, I expected to be solidly entertained that night with dinner AND a show. Well guess what? I was kinda disappointed. Yes, you heard me. Disappointed. I mean, I got dinner...but no show. No craziness, no need to send back food, no one getting kicked out, no yelling. No draahmah. Boo. Now about dinner- it was...good. Seriously. We got the Three Cheese White Pizza and Chicken Fettucine Aflredo. The crust was thin and slightly crispy (not under cooked at all), and we loved the chunks of goat cheese. The Chicken Fettucine Aflredo was simple but ahhmazing. The Fettucine was perfectly al dente (I hate soggy pasta noodles!), the chicken was juicy, and the sauce was like crack. I could DRINK that sauce. Afterwards, Hubs picked out the ""Gordon Ramsay"" chocolate cake and I chose the creme brulee for dessert. I wasn't wowed by either after experiencing the crack-Alfredo-sauce, but they were still well made desserts. Our sever, Deborah, was really sweet, our water glasses never went more than half empty, and Samy asked us how our food was on our way out. The restaurant itself was beautiful, and the dim lighting made it so romantic. You could really tell that they put a lot of thought into the decor in order to create that kind of ambiance. On another note, I saw Amy poke her head out to take pictures with a couple customers. I really wanted to ask for a picture, but Hubs told me to not be such a tourist. Why did I listen to him? I'm back in Austin now, and I still want mah picture!Upon paying, I couldn't help but ask Deborah about the tipping situation. This led us to chatting about the show a bit. She mentioned that many things were edited out (like Gordon cursing at Amy) to make the owners seem crazier. Sure, the scenes that were aired did take place, but the entertainment industry is very good at doing its job...and its job is to make a good show. And as for the tipping- well, Deborah said she keeps her tips. She seemed very genuine, and I, for one, am not going to question her claim. So there you have it. I got to visit the highly publicized Amy's Baking Company this weekend. I didn't witness any entertaining shenanigans. Just walked away with a happy belly, y'all."
2014-08-31,70ocFHu-wq6F1u-booF86Q,"Barf. Food was nasty. I would not recommend. The dessert tasted old... Like when did you make this, last year? I made a special trip to visit this and blehhhh don't do it! Do not eat the cat food they are serving."
2015-02-17,718gd9Ku9LAt-yYzTnD1Qw,"Went to have a nice lunch with my friends, the service was horride and my food wasn't cooked well enough to where it was good to eat! The dessert was the only good part. It was delicious but overall i wouldnt recommended this place unless you want to be treated unfairly  and be yelled at"
2015-06-16,7IN_45NVFXXFb8bEzkZZbg,"If you time it perfectly, you might catch them open. :) The food was very good, but the service made me nervous the first few times I went (before the tv incident) because the server (owner) seemed very impatient. I always like to ask them what their favorite dish is, and he just blurted out ""Just tell me what you like!"" The last time I went (after the show), he seemed to try to be nicer. Again, the food is good"
2016-10-17,7KGUA1MnwXlLIpYctCOAXA,Pos place.  Bunch of fugazi owner.  Threw up eating cat food. Gordon Ramsey need to go back here and clean this shit up
2015-04-08,7RFFzQqGUeROfqHGEKXE1w,Okay my husband and I went to Amy's Baking Company yesterday why we were visiting in Scottsdale Arizona.  We heard about them on Kitchen Nightmares. I wasn't expecting them to be all that great but let me tell you. Amy and Samy are amazing!!!! I don't believe everything I see on tv and for good reason. The food was good!!The restaurant was beautiful and the food we ordered was great. My family and I go out to eat all the time when we travel.  My daughter wasn't sure if she wanted to order because of the reviews and stuff but reluctantly she did.  She loved her basil spaghetti.  My salami and arugula was great too. I have eaten at places that were okay and the food tasted like crap. Amy's food is delicious and we were pleasantly surprised.I believe people should give them a chance if they ever visit in Scottsdale you will be surprised!!
2015-03-18,7TmEt-jOEqK9JltOnEgzTw,"Let me start out by saying I really WANTED to hate this place after seeing the tv show. My wife and I are vacationing in scotsdale and said we had to go check it out for ourselves. We walked in and the environment was so friendly. We were greeted by Sammy and he asked us to sit down wherever we liked, we sat down and ordered the herbed flatbread. And wow was it delicious. Clearly homemade bread with a perfect blend of herbs. We then decided to split the Brie, apple, and prosciutto with an apple compote,it comes with a side salad with a citrus honey dressing that was absolutely to die for. The sandwich was nothing short of perfect. We made our way over to the baked goods counter and got two desserts. The chocolate cake and the creme brule cheesecake. I couldn't stop eating the decedent cake. It was gone within 5 bites. The cheesecake was also amazing but we decided to save it for the family to try. I gave this 5 stars because I couldn't find a single thing wrong with the restaurant. After we ate, Sammy shook both our hands and said thank you for coming in. I will be back for more food and dessert. I highly recommend this restaurant. I wish they were in El Paso."
2013-08-25,7_laUpgjwmHJ-n--VxdnfQ,"OMG I tried the pizza and it was terribly tasteless and really didn't spend enough time baking in the oven. I could feel cold cheese sliding down my throat. We also got a Burger that was very mediocre, had tomato and lettuce that reminded of the poor vegetation I received from my high school cafeteria. The first time I came here I ordered a birthday cake and they spelled the name wrong and was very rude when I nicely asked to get that fixed. Amy accused me of not knowing what I was doing and that I should be more clear next time, hello it their own fault they couldn't get the name on the cake right even after I spelled it out for her. She was extremely rude and just gave me this nastiest look with her crazy eyes that looks like it came from a killer Chucky doll. Her stare will kill you. I didn't even dare leave a tip because I heard Amy and her husband would pocket it and keep it away from the rest of their staff. Here's a tip for all you Yelpers, stay away from this place, this restaurant is an absolute travesty to the neighborhood and the restaurant and bakery business in general."
2014-06-05,7ic3J3basRkDcgNVz6KLEw,I went here and we had two desserts. Both were excellent! The owners were attentive and the restaurant was spotless which means that they really care! Will definitely be going back!
2013-05-31,7mXq-RTSbo3BaPvMS96PyQ,"Of course the hype drove me to visit this restaurant while visiting my friend in Mesa.Was immediately put off when asked why we had selected to come to this restaurant.  It's bad news to be suspicious of customers from the get go.  I was honest saying it was solely because of the dramatic Kitchen Nightmares episode, but Samy seemed appreciative of the fact that I would like to form my own opinion and we took a seat inside.I ordered the 3 cheese with tomato sauce pizza, and my friend got the Pesto Spinach Ravioli.  The wait for the food took forever, I had gotten up twice to use the restroom from all the water I was drinking.The pizza was undercooked and floppy, but I didn't want to send it back for fear it would take a significant amount of time to get it back, so I sort of just picked at it.  My friend said the ravioli was okay but nothing too splendid, leaving about half of it uneaten.Samy came over to question why we hadn't eaten all of our food, so I voiced my complaint about the undercooked pizza and that my friend said his dish wasn't anything special.  This was apparently the wrong thing to say as we got a tongue lashing from Samy about how our opinion of our food was wrong.  He continued talking bad about my friend and I as he went in the back, and then we overheard Amy chime in about how little we knew since we weren't from around the area.She got into such a fit that Samy came back and started yelling at as to leave because we had upset his wife with our slanderous comments and that we were nothing more than pathetic bullies.  We left what we owed on the table and left.Stay away from this place unless you really want to affirm the craziness that was shown on television."
2013-12-22,7zjNEasBYuuz4iXHivrXkw,"Ok, so reluctantly , before a movie , we went into ABC , I ordered a burger , supposedly one of the worst dishes they serve.  I asked for it cooked a certain way. I didn't expect it to be great , Samy waited on us and could not Have been nicer,  I have to be honest , one of my favorite burgers , cooked perfect , bun was great , I don't know what people are talking about , I even told Samy , the food was great , and I am very particular.  So , go in ,my son had the ceasar salad , his wife the onion soup , both loved their dishes.  When I want a burger , I will go back."
2014-04-26,8-r9ymeQ-hmqxvHA3ZC8Sg,"From canada, was skeptical after the media and reading the reviews so I came in there expecting the worst and got an amazing outcome actually. Delicious vanilla bean vodka, and the chicken parm was one of the best things I've ate in a long time. Both Amy and Sammy were overly gracious and will for sure go back."
2018-06-14,803wmOZSuJidqxdfpmsdHg,This place sucks! I've been there while visiting the mainland Year's ago! And I didn't even know it was a kitchen nightmares special. The lady and old dude working there are freaking crazy and cursed out everyone that had any kind of concern about their food! After watching kitchen nightmares after visiting I realized these people are nuts and deserve ever bit of the bad publicity they get! Go there only to be entertained by psychotic people. It's like watching Jerry Springer on crack!!!  Lol
2014-04-21,81oHDSsk-VRJm-Bnn_ex1A,"Went to Arizona for a guy's golf trip, and tried this restaurant. Actually desserts are surprisingly REALLY GOOD! Not sure if they order it in, or prepare in-house. But it doesn't matter, they were really tasty.The entrees, that's another issue in itself. I am giving it two stars because the gnocchi was nasty. But then again, this place isn't called Amy's Pasta Company. Its Amy's Baking Company.I say only come for coffee and dessert, and you will have a 5 start experience."
2014-03-06,8C5nGIKlOM4xIsW94-JXkg,"Terrible food. Way over priced. I tried to tip the waitress and she looked around before taking it. Whoever give this place 5 stars must've just came out of prison and forgot what real food should taste like. Items ordered was either very soggy (Burger) or tastes as if it was frozen (pasta). I heard that they were on TV and I should have known they was on show called Kitchen Nightmares cause that's exactly what is was. A nightmare.    If you want frozen food save your money and get a $2 sandwich from McDonalds at least there you know you get what you paid for. These morons that give this place 5 stars with all these photos attached have to be paid insiders cause the food looked nothing like what I either saw or received. I will never insult my taste buds again. I can probably get a better meal cooked by a three legged, one eyed cat before this place produces anything other than below sub-par. I wont waste time saying staff front house was horrid (outside of the poor waitress who look like she was apart of some waitress sweat shop hoping to be saved from her employment hell). Im sure everyone else already mentioned it right? Yea I know."
2014-08-26,8E32usSArl813PHhK2SghQ,This place was absolutely the opposite of what the negative people try to portray it as! Sammy is just the most welcoming person ever and they even play along with the bad rep given to them while interacting with their customers! Got to meet both of them and will definitely be recommending it to others! Don't listen to the trolls go for yourselves people!
2010-08-04,8L-YKPg8Hrque5bVxADFyg,"I've eaten there several times and will go back.  Amy didn't react well and I'm sure she regrets it now, but the food has always been good and the service polite and friendly, so I won't let this battle keep me away."
2014-08-19,8URFo6x1LFfuGxfQEtnjqg,"Been going there for years and will continue to do so.  The fig pizza is amazing, the salads are the best in the city, and the baked goods.... .to die for.    Gordon Ramsey is an idiot and he should be sued, so many clowns have jumped on the bandwagon.  But Amy & Sammy are polite and attentive to their guests and the food is awesome and moderately priced."
2014-08-02,8bt72A6HmQgOGJhgkVoA9A,The food is frozen the owners are  two  people in denial they are rude no class fools that do not belong in the food or any type of  contact with the public she out there in left field and he's clueless
2014-05-15,8ciBoDc4x8Es6tJp5fJhiQ,"Called the place and told him that I had a group of 10 ladies what were going to come in. Asked what time they were open till and he said 9, but they close the kitchen at 8:30... When I told him we were going to be in around 8 and he told me that there was nothing he could do and wouldn't accept my business. Welp fuck you too dude."
2014-02-09,8eVdfEe2c8c8IUCW2M9uGQ,"I give them 5 stars because their desserts are pretty good! I personally met Sammy and Amy both tonight. They were very nice and I commend them for going through what they did and still sticking it through. It was actually pretty busy, and they provided impeccable service. I had a chai tea latte, and my friend wanted a dirty chai tea latte which they do not have on their menu... Sammy asked what a dirty chai tea latte was, and went out of his way to make him one! Very nice of him. They were very friendly, and welcoming."
2014-06-10,8vFdPfwvSrRriEzuRHLQDg,"I have to admit I saw the show and have read the reviews but must say today was a pleasant surprise, I enjoyed the pizza. The service was right to the point and I was not only well informed of today's specials but learned what was on the menu. I had the Napalitano Pizza which boasted a fresh roasted garlic I enjoyed. My friend had the Blue Ribbon Burger which was enjoyed but seemed overpriced at $15. Add $5 for french fries and it is not a $20 burger, not bad, just not worth the price. All in all, not bad food which made me happy but not so good to ignore the price. Better than I thought going into it. Enjoy!"
2014-05-16,8wKgBBtKw_PtuFDz0dAzvA,"Delicious and entertaining! I flew in Scottsdale and this was my first stop.  Had to visit these awesome personalities.  I was seated by a waitress. Sammy came right away and directed the waitress to seat me in a more spacious location.  I decline and told him this was my choosing.  He looked stymied.   It was epic. Then we chatted about a good five minutes.  I love his passion and it's well deserved as their restaurant shows a lot of pride of ownership.  I ordered the hummus as it doesn't come with bread he recommended that I order bread with it but I declined.   I said I will use the pizza for that.  He was puzzled by his logic. The hummus was one of the best I tasted. And I know hummus.  Ask for less olive oil on top if are not used to it. I ordered the fig, prosciutto pizza and has a a slice from another guest of BBQ mango chicken.  Both were incredible Other mentions.  He said he was scammed by kitchen nightmares. With paid actors and editing.  Also Sammy is originally from Israel.  I was guessing Italian or Lebanese. Also great job Amy! You are truly a artist. I'm already craving the hummus.  All in all great food.  Fun people. Go!"
2015-12-02,8z-gipHHulR2HAeAE3pWpw,"Meg and I were out on a dinner date in North Scottsdale and on our way home, we decided to stop by ABC for dessert. We had heard all the reviews and watched the KN episode but we cam in with an open mind to give Sammy and Amy an open minded and fair chance.On our way to the door, Sammy greeted us in a friendly an humorous manner, sporting one of his ""I'm the Gangster"" t-shirts. He was very pleasant to speak with and even offered to take a picture with us. It was clear from the moment we got there that Sammy was doing his best to make light of the past negativity and continue forward with a good attitude.We had a hard time choosing between all the delicious looking cakes but we finally decided on the Candy Bar Tart at Sammy's recommendation. It was definitely worth the stop! A very crunchy cookie crust, rich mousse filling, and topped with some chocolate candies was knock out amazing. While it could easily have been split for four, the two of us absolutely destroyed it without a hint of guilt.While we were there, A few out of town visitors also came in and struck up conversation with Sammy. They admitted that they had never seen the KN episode when Sammy asked what brought them in. This sparked up my only complaint as Sammy an explanation about what happened in the KN episode and their interaction with Chef Ramsay. The explanation that was given was definitely over exaggerated and you could tell it was still a major sore spot for Sammy and Amy. While I think it is good to make light of the past with the shirts and the Disney style meet and greet outside, the over the top rehash of the KN episode and their perception of negative reviewers (not to be confused with troll reviews) is toxic and best left in the past where it belongs.  Were ABC's still around, my best advise would be to leave the stories behind and move forward.But despite the hiccup with the KN explanation, we had a great time! Sammy's service was great and very friendly. We even came back about a month later to try another tart (I think it was a coffee tart but can't say for sure). Both times we came in it was towards closing so it was only Sammy in the front so I can't speak to any of the servers performance. Nor did we get to meet Amy but could hear she was in the back cleaning the kitchen up for the evening so that's understandable.I wish we'd gotten a chance to come in and try out a lunch/dinner plate but sadly that wasn't in the cards for us. If Sammy and Amy give the restaurant business another shot, I would definitely come in to try them out again with one condition: They keep putting awesome baking goods on the dessert menu!"
2014-04-18,92iEVgUbk9i0YZgl6J0AwQ,"For the dear Sammy & AmyThis is my first review ever on Yelp, and if I can only give a one time review to any restaurant I would choose Amy's Baking Company, because hands down, you have one of the best fetuccini and pizza, ever. We were warmly greeted by Sammy's smile as we walked into this divinely elegant restaurant. My husband couldn't stop telling me how much he liked the decorations and the atmosphere. The amazing food took only 15 minutes until it was served on our table, not to mention Amy was the only chef in there. Overwhelmingly outstanding. Just because of one episode, the whole world judges on something they have never physically tasted, smelled or seen in real life. I have tasted, smelled and tasted, and it is  simply brilliant. Sammy & Amy, if your restaurant is not that GOOD or BIG, then you wouldn't get that many attacks. It is because your restaurant is that GOOD that you get so many haters. Haters are gonna hate. Ignore them and fight on! Can't wait to see you two again! We love you!"
2014-09-09,94dYbSY-i1HG6La1QT6Hlw,We decided to try Amy's Baking Company of course after seeing it on TV.  I always go in with an open mind when you hear the negative so much.  We decided to try it out for lunch today and were really happy with everything.  Sammie sat us and was as nice as can be.  We ordered the gnocchi bolognese and the pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Both were super good!  The flavors were really great on both.  The crust was perfect on the pizza.  I can tell they use really fresh ingredients.  At the end of our meal Amy came out to say hi.  We will be back.  I would encourage people to try the restaurant and give it a shot before you write a review just because you saw it on a tv show.  Yelp reviews should be honest.
2014-09-21,9Iv6cErwCaIrTYJdhltt_g,Everything about this place makes my skin crawl. That seems weird given it's such a pretty restaurant... That just goes to show how people and food effect everything. I would rather eat at a nasty sticky Waffle House! Seriously.. I have never been around such horrible people in my entire life. The food is just awful and you better not complain about it. Makes my heart hurt so much and I feel such pitty for those who feel ugliness is necessary.. Sad... Sad... STAY AWAY! Not worth putting yourself through that kind of experience..
2014-08-19,9Qe3S9npwmoO78ERaCf4qQ,I have been to this place several times and have had great experiences everytime. Sammy is very friendly everytime I walk in Sammy greets me. I have had the salad several times and it's the best I have  ever had. I also highly recommend the desert.
2013-11-03,9QpQu2akqhIvp1n0JTkw-A,"I had a great time! The food was good, the owner was very friendly and nice, at one point the chef came out to introduce herself! After watching chef ramseys show I had low expectations and I admit I was a little biased.   I fully recommend this place and I will definitely eat here again!"
2014-04-11,9_fnXAz7Ytqf274Bm5DC-Q,"We vacationed in Arizona the in December 2013.  We happened upon Amy's, at the time we didn't know Gordon Ramsey had been here.  The food wasn't the worst we ate on our trip but it was at the bottom of the list.  The owner treated a man horrible for complaining about his food.  We were told by someone at another table to give the waiter the tip without the owner finding out because they take tips from the waiters, we couldn't believe it, I'm sure this is illegal.  We had burgers that had no taste and really soggy.  Tonight I'm seeing them on TV, I couldn't believe they said they have excellent food, what a joke."
2014-08-04,9hRdLniatoheAEEk25D9Dg,"Was back in Scottsdale last night and had to return to Amy's. Food was absolutely amazing! I had the humus again which is out if this world and also enjoyed the Fig and Prosciutto pizza. Had to have desert, so I tried the cheesecake. I'm from NY originally so I know cheesecake. Amy's was one of the best I ever had!!Samy and Amy thank you for an enjoyable evening. I hope to return soon. All the best!!!BobThe Pilot"
2014-05-11,9jljVOXiFdXW-S35ArdPNA,"I was in Scottsdale on business and decided to give this place a try. Ordered the Blue Ribbon burger. I nearly puked, it was like a wet sponge soaked in grease. Owners were rude and obnoxious when I complained. NEVER AGAIN!"
2013-05-24,9lKCs1d4AE5eOmtIpuviAA,"Four of us had reservations for the ""Grand ReOpening"" thursday 23 May 2013 and were turned down at the door before getting inside. Samy came to the door as we walked up, he was very nice but seemed frazzled, and we said we had reservations from a couple days ago. He mentioned that they had fired their PR company and were no longer accepting any of the reservations. We never got an email back or a call about that cancellation. Nobody was inside seated but roughly 4-5 employees were standing about. We looked inside after the 'no reservations' comment... and asked if we could still be seated and order?  Samy promptly replied ""No sorry we are closed"".  We walked away.Now... we walked up excited to check it out and were going in with good intentions... everybody deserves a first-hand look and review of their own. But they're continuously turning down paying customers... I've seen the show. I've seen the mess on their FB and social media. I was around when the original Yelp stuff went down with Joel and then on ChowBella...  It's a story for sure. Just wish I was able to try it out for myself. Not sure where they'll be in 6mo..."
2014-04-11,9lnDwLb8FRX6j58O-v-oNQ,"I didn't spend much time in Amy's but I give this place 4 Stars upon my first impression. It was a hot day in AZ and I walked into the welcomed feeling of the clean and cooled air conditioned bakery.  Amy greeted me nicely and asked what she could help me with. It was difficult to choose just one dessert amongst all of the rich delicious looking desserts in the cooler. I chose a delicious pastry with chocolate icing and caramel nuts.  Amy grabbed the dessert and told me how it was best served. I appreciated that little tip.  Sammy was also there, we had enjoyable small talk as he rang me up.  I tried to resist temptation, but I had to take a bite of the dessert before I left their parking lot. It was delicious!The only this is that most desserts are $10.00! Kinda expensive for a dessert, but I'd definitely go back and try other things."
2014-10-05,9mVIEIkbbpp7i_WN8EdiIg,Over priced and terrible quality food plain and simple. Please go out of business already we don't need terrible food from delusional owners.
2015-03-28,9qr0bRxWAfBK_dT-jk5fig,"wow, Crazy Amy is one the rudest people I have ever met, this was the worst experience my wife and I had while eating out. We actually came here hoping Kitchen Nightmares was wrong but we were wrong. The only reason people eat here is because crazy said she believes in God."
2013-06-13,AHdyDTtqmCnTuQ2XdXt7Fw,"Ok, maybe I'm to picky or something, or Chicago just has unbelievable restaurants, but geeeez.  So my wife's birthday was the seventh of June, and we came out for the weekend to hang with her beloved cousin that lives in the area ( I myself am not a fan of AZ)  Her cousin said she had reservations at this restaurant that had all this hype. Let me say that the waitress was nice, but seemed kinda confused at times. Also an older guy seemed overly ""curious"" about what we were doing, just because my wife's cousin took a pic with her cell phone. Kinda uncomfortable.....So we got hummus that came with bread, and two pizzas to share. Now, I don't know if its because I'm used to Chicago pizza that's amazing , but YUCK!! LIMP doughy-ness, that took what felt like a life time to come. Let me just say LOTS left over, that we DID NOT want to take with us. PASS!!"
2013-10-14,AIVgQY1-2O8gVFevmys3_Q,"My friend and I were studying at Barnes and Noble and we decided to go to ABC for dinner. Actually, she did not want to go. She had some irrational fear of Sammy, but I made her come with me.It was around 5:45 pm when we came in on Saturday and the place was empty. Pita Jungle was packed next door. Thanks Gordon Ramsey!Honestly, the food was pretty good. The portions were pretty good too. The prices are bit steep at ABC, but the restaurant is in Snobbsdale. (I grew up in Mesa).Overall, the place wasn't too bad. I probably won't be back unless I have out-of-state friends who want to check out ABC."
2014-07-10,AKrUXLLKGy-cZft2t1Z-Kg,"If I could possibly give this restaurant no stars  I would, I feel bad for the service staff the management really treats them poorly as for the food it's just is poor. I have to agree with the others the burger I had was undercooked and bland as well runny with grease. We sent my burger back it took over 30 minutes to get another one. Some of the other people in our group had ravioli some more cooked and some were frozen still in the middle.We will never return, the word of this restaurant I can almost guarantee you will be disappointed."
2014-10-19,ANb782I9Pqw6Gw3xFaxRwQ,"While driving back from AZ to L.A., I had the chance to stop by the notorious Amy's Baking Company in Scottsdale. With no sign of screaming management, unfairly treated service staff, or even the pretense of mild celebrity, my experience at A.B.C. was excellent from start to finish.My friendly server started me off with a house pinot grigio and Amy's Signature Homemade Soup of the Day, which was a carrot soup. The portion was generous and the soup itself was excellent, rich, and full of taste. The accompanying challah roll was warm, soft, and quite fresh (no possible chance this could have been made anywhere except in house). For my meal I had a prosciutto panini with an apple compote (I am mangling the exact phrasing of the item name, my apologies), and it was food porn. The bread, the very fresh greens, everything went together well. And the side of kale slaw that came with it was an inspired idea, and quite tasty.However, nothing sealed the deal quite like the apple and peanut butter cheesecake. Pardon my language, but holy shit. I ate that one on the drive home and nearly took out part of I-10 having a food-gasm. It was somehow even better than it sounds (the cheesecake, not my driving - I am a horrible driver), and it sounds like Christmas. The other desserts featured in the bakery display were all quite impressive, and all had no store-bought appearance to them whatsoever.I had the pleasure of meeting Amy and Sammy after my meal, and they were both quite friendly, polite, and gracious. For however they might have been portrayed on television I assure you, there's no pretense of that in this establishment, which boasts an impressive, healthy, and fresh dining experience. As a spectacle, there's nothing to this place. As a restaurant, Amy and Sammy clearly have a talent, and I wish their business much success."
2015-01-04,ATGMESfQ0Ox5pe3NGhYsoA,"Traveling through Scottsdale and decided to stop and see if this ""nightmare"" was really so bad! Walked in, and Sammy was right there! He was very nice and sat us at a table and we picked out some desserts. As it was the middle of the afternoon, not many people were in and we just decided to get desserts. After looking at all the beautiful cakes, we decided to get the Creme Brûlée and a Piña Colada cake. First bite and we loved it! Nothing like the disaster we thought we were walking into. Amy even came out to say hi and later we asked to take a picture (they had no problem with this and seemed quite used to it after the show). Great experience and if I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I will be sure to stop in and get a sweet treat!Love, the Texans!"
2014-04-24,AoMLbkVOux25iiZAGj9T_g,My sister & I stopped in to ABC this afternoon. Although it was 3:45 pm there was a sign on the door that said they would reopen at 5 pm.  Posted hours are 12 - 9 but as we were walking away the sign was removed and we were welcomed in.Sammy was gracious and did not intrude on our conversation.  My sister ordered Chocolate Mousse & peanut butter cake which she said was great.  I ordered coffee and french onion soup.  I do have to say that I am a coffee and french onion soup snob.What a pleasant surprise to have my delicious coffee arrive in a french press with a demitasse cup and spoon and small ceramic creamer.  The french onion soup was delicious and just as it should be with a biscuit and cheese.The ladies at the next table were having the flat bread that my sister and I wished we  had ordered.  They also received large beautiful salads.We will go back.
2014-11-29,AqNZpf9MxHwOVxckwQe-2A,"Went after work a couple weeks ago because I had heard about Amy's lemon meringue tart.  At first I was a little hesitant because the desserts are $10 each, but totally worth it! Both Amy and Sammy were a delight to speak with.  We really want to go back for her food!"
2013-09-06,B3-xWNTwmG9PstuA6dmJ7w,These people do not deserve a restaurant or customers. Period. Their initial investment should be obliterated and they should never be in the business again. How can you go to a restaurant that steals its waiters tips? It's insane. I'm not even sure how it's legal.
2014-09-26,BE2eCZYSpxzNviw8nbBepw,"I watch Ramsay show sometimes , I saw different things , but never I saw so stubborn , angry , selfish owners like you-Amy ! I can't believe you guys keep tips - don't have a right to do that! You don't have a right to treat people the way you treat your employees !!!! They also humans if you didn't know , just because they came work for u don't mean u owned them! I don't care how u cook ( but u probably can't cook , I trust the Chef )  I would never eat food that you prepared , it's must have some of those poison you sprinkle from your ugly mouth ! I hope one of those poor people who happened to work for u , sue the hell out of u !!!! I wish there is law that can punish that kind of ppl like u! You an ugly horrible person , your soul is ugly to me! Hope u go out of business straight to hell for all that u done !!!!!!!!!!"
2015-03-06,BSUhhRXV87q1IpoAkkF9Eg,We ate there today for the first time (3/6/15) and it was wonderful. Samy gave us great service. Amy gave us great food. We had pita bread and hummus and salads. Give them a try. I really think Gordon Ramsey got this one wrong. This was not a Kitchen Nightmare but a Kitchen Paradise.
2014-05-02,BbTVSDWy5128KPzFQBIcag,"I wish I could go lower than one star. Absolutely horrible owners. My food was under-cooked and cold, and when I told them about it they flipped out and told me to get out of their restaurant. SUCH a bad place, and will never visit again. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Also, ALL of the tip you give goes to the owner, not the waitresses/waiters. Pathetic."
2014-04-25,C-GkilcStEQMJXg2qBXkgg,"I was going to give a 5 star rating because, for who they are, the owners are busting their buts to have their own type of restaurant. But after I saw the follow up on KN tonight, I can only give 1 star, even BEFORE I come to the restaurant. The reason for this is so little has changed since the original airing of the show and after what I saw on the update show recently.I will be visiting the restaurant on my next trip out West. In response to the owner's  comments on KN recently, I will introduce myself and show Amy my Ylep post. I'm not hiding behind my computer. After I come, I will not return again since the husband said ""stuppid people will become smart and come back"".The purpose of me writing this review is that  I had  the hope the owners would change their attitude towards their employees. They don't understand that although employees do not own the restaurant, they can make or break a business. I beg of owners to learn to treat them better and think about how it felt when they had to work for someone else. Since they fired the entire original staff, I'm not too optomistic. Employees don't owe you anything, they are there to provide a service to you for a fee. When you start to take those fees away (the tips they earn), then you are in the wrong. How you treat our future leaders will come back to haunt you.Lastly, I am expecting good food and good service, if I don't receive that I will make it known to you. I did notice the business is still not growing and the restaurant has few customers. All you have to do is read the posts on review sites the same way everyone else does and you will get your answers to WHY?"
2014-07-01,C6eybJ2JqrfwQ9zm3O-DlA,I had the hummus and pizza.  All I can say is season stuff and start to cook the pizzas.  Very pricey and not worth a repeat visit
2014-05-08,CDk9hy2S5lKAYDalyJs32A,DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!   I ordered a margherita pizza and it was doughy and soggy I asked the waiter if she could put it in the oven a bit longer. 2 minutes later one of the owners Sammy comes out and starts screaming at me telling me to get the fuck out of his restaurant. Then the other owner amy came out and joined in with her husband. They said I couldn't leave until I paid for the shitty pizza. I threatened to call the cops and they got out of the way. I have never experienced anything like this. Rumor has it Amy is obsessed with her cats and thinks their human beings. And Sammy her husband steals the waitresses tips.
2013-06-02,CF0piXbgVSqw2frgjMZikQ,"Went to Amy's Baking Company for dinner tonight.  Hmmm....it wasn't.....terrible.  But that doesn't mean it was good.  Here's the deal:  the 3  cheese white pizza I ordered had no flavor and had the consistency of a custard pie - I think it was the egg that was in there (on the menu it listed the cheese and garlic and the last ingredient listed was ""egg"" - my fiance and I were puzzled over that but I thought I'd try it anyway).  Fiance's  pepperoni pizza was really good.  My 11 year old son's salad came with onions in it when I asked for it with no onions and his entree followed about 2 minutes later and (I timed this part) 13 minutes before our pizza. His pasta was simple olive oil, parmesan cheese and garlic - it was cold!  Also, my fiance's soda came with ice when he explicitly asked for no ice.  And that is the real problem...our dinner including tip was $105.  For $35/person you expect attention to details and excellent customer service. The deserts were $10 a piece and were REALLY good - I think she may indeed make them as the flourless chocolate cake had ""Meow"" written on them (I got one that said ""Love"" and really wanted one that said ""Meow"" - I totally would have taken a picture of that).  The service was subpar at best.  I told my fiance that if the price had been half as much as it was and the egg was left out of the pizza I might have felt that it was OK.  Instead I was left feeling just ""blah"" - no drama, just not memorable either!  We went to form our own opinion after the Kitchen Nightmares fiasco - and while it wasn't as horrible as we were afraid it wasn't great either."
2015-02-17,COavW_WHpf4oH_wqXwSiZw,"I stopped in to pick up a dessert for a special occasion one afternoon. Sammy was extremely nice. He was helpful, and I will return for a meal another time. The dessert was amazing. The best we have ever had."
2014-05-08,CQUjScPH5eVhdEZfb4Plsg,"I was in the area visiting friends in January 2014. I suggested to them to go to ABC for dinner and they looked at me like I was insane with that decision. I had seen the Kitchen nightmares episode and I wanted to give my own review from my own perspective and not from what ""Reality"" TV can show.First, I have to say that I had desert first (Personal policy of mine). Which was the chocolate cake and it was absolutely delicious. So As far as desserts I give AMY 5 stars.NOW, the rest of the experience was where it all went down hill drastically. I ordered a pizza, and the outer crust was beautiful and very rustic like. The actual innards of the pizza was raw and soggy. the flavor was strong with garlic on one side and completely bland on the other side. I sent it back asking if it could be put back in the oven for another 10 minutes and the SHRILL scream that came from the kitchen was enough to make me lose my appetite. My friends had gnocchi which tasted freezer burned and no matter how much sauce is put on, the freezer burn taste doesn't go away.It's a beautiful restaurant and well worth the money put into it, but our server was so nervous and jumpy afraid that she would do anything wrong. When I asked if she gets the tips from the tables, she shook her head no, Since I was paying the bill, I paid it in cash to the penny, and then I sought out my server and gave her a 30% tip for putting up with the environment she works under.In my opinion, all of these glowing 5 star rating must be from friends or relatives to offset the lower ratings. I'm from NJ so I didn't travel 3000 miles to ""Bully"" these people. I wanted to form my own opinion and it spoke for itself.How they are open is a mystery. However, I do wish them well and that they continue to grow and learn and be open minded"
2012-10-02,CXOaSu57JbTEyL3-g7VJzg,"I'm crazy about Amy's!  I went there for the first time a few months ago and now I can't get enough! Their pizza is my favorite in town and their pastas are delicious! My favorites are the creamy pesto raviolis with spinach and pancetta, and the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. The best Alfredo sauce I've ever had! They recently added crepes to their menu and they all sound amazing! I've had the almond one for dessert and oh my it was heaven in every bite! The owners are great and you can tell Amy is very passionate about her food. Every dessert is to die for so make sure you save room! The key lime pie is my fave! I eat out a lot and at very nice restaurants but Amy's wins the prize as my favorite! Besides Amy's food being incredible, it's the owners that make it so fun to come back every time!"
2012-12-12,CfBvSdPo5J_c6zEX_iLrZw,"I went to Amy's for the second time last night, and had a wonderful experience. The couple that run the place are so sincere and accommodating, they treat you like a friend instead of a patron. The menu is reasonably priced with plenty of pizza, pasta and sandwich options to suit every palate. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing, the perfect place for a weeknight wind down with a glass of wine. I ordered the Garlic Chicken Mushroom Pizza which was amazing. The pizza dough was spectacular, thick enough to hold the pesto without getting soggy, yet still soft and the crust is the best part. Amy's is a hidden gem in Scottsdale, you will not be disappointed when you dine there!"
2014-02-10,CkM9FtxelvahpE9StyON3A,"""Are you lovers or haters?""That's how Amy's Baking Company owner Samy Bouzaglo greeted my platonic girl friend and I when we walked into the notorious eatery made famous by Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Well, we do love each other, so we hesitantly answered ""lovers"" before taking a seat outside on the patio of the nearly-empty restaurant.Samy was our server and was extremely cheerful and smiley - how a welcoming host should be. He was helpful in talking about the menu, explaining the 12-inch Garlic Mushroom Chicken pizza ($15) my friend ordered would be big enough to share - it definitely was - and he brought out our drinks cheerfully.The food seemed to take a little long to deliver, more than 20 minutes, considering there were only maybe a couple other tables filled inside, but hopefully that's because Amy, whom we met, was actually making everything by scratch.We both really enjoyed our food. I thought my dish, the Tomato Spinach Ravioli with a tomato cream sauce and fresh spinach, was really tasty -- though I have no idea if the pasta was fresh or frozen. I really liked the cream sauce, and the ravioli filling was scrumptious, too. I did think, at only about four ravioli per dish, it was a little overpriced at $14, though.Most of the menu's entrees are around $15, which makes eating lunch here pretty pricey. And though the pizza was massive enough for my friend to take half home, it'd be cooler if there were smaller, less expensive portions to choose from at lunch.I did get a to-go dessert, a slice of delicious blueberry pie. Samy did insist Amy makes all the desserts, so I'll give kudos to her since they all looked great. But my pie slice was $10 - again, pretty pricey.I have to admit I was really scared to go to Amy's Baking Company, since I'd seen the episode of Kitchen Nightmares they were featured in, and they're back on again on Friday, February 28 on FOX. As we were leaving, Samy and Amy said, ""There's about to be a war"" - possibly alluding to what happened during the filming of the new episode. I'm super-curious what went down and will not go back until the next airing - but for now, I'm glad I at least made it out alive with a happily full stomach."
2014-10-19,CpWA716WMuMMlSzTDaRb0A,"Was visiting old friends in Scottsdale and on my way to return back east. Stopped in last evening (10/18) this place for a quick bite. What brought me in was it looked nice from the outside. The place wasn't busy and now I know why.  An older gentleman seated me and all seemed nice. A lady (I'm guessing she's Amy because I did hear ""I'm the boss here.."") was bickering to some other staff member. I couldn't hear all of it, but it did make me nervous because she was obviously ticked off about something. This lady then walked around with what was obviously a forced smile and looking for things to tell others to do. This made the atmosphere a bit ""tense"".  I kind of got the feeling like she would come over to me and tell me to move or something because I wasn't sitting in the right place.  The menu was OK and the prices were a bit steep. (More like the prices you'd see in a closed venue, where you have to buy what's there, so prices are high.) I wound up getting a salad, figuring how could anything be wrong with that. It was ""OK"" - a bit bland and not worth the $$, but it wasn't bad. My server told me the desserts were great and I asked for the opinion on which was the best. I was told the cheesecake. Got that and while it was good, it was so-so.  So why 2 stars? Simply because of prices, portion size and the food being just so-so. My server did ask, sort of in a whisper, ""Did you hear about us from TV?"" I said no and was informed  ""this place was on Kitchen Nightmares"". I don't watch reality TV or that show, so I didn't know.  I certainly wouldn't call this place a nightmare, but it does need some help. They should put more effort into the food, prices and creating a less ""tense"" atmosphere, instead of decor. When I left, the phrase that came to mind was not judging a book by its cover.  Now that I am back home (and recovering from jet lag from last nights flight), I am going to go to a local small restaurant that isn't ""beautiful"", but the food and service are worth 5 stars! If Amy's Baking Company was on that show, I hope they learned something and are in the process of changing. I'll be back in AZ visiting next year and will ask my friends there if they recommend this place then."
2013-06-27,CsNw_c32QWPXDT5jNKZYGA,"visiting my aunt in phoenix for a week and a half from halifax ns and wanted to check the place out after seeing it on tv last month. it was a bit of a drive and the restaurant wasnt as hard to find as i thought it would be but i followed the gps in the car. parking wasnt bad at all.upon arrival, sammy came and offered us a seat. the restaurant was really nice looking and the glass case of deserts at the counter looked pretty damn good. anyways, when we were seated sammy offered us drinks and water right away. the place was somewhat busy but not overly crowded. when we got our drinks, we got our menus. im not a huge salad or pasta person so i ordered a garlic chicken mushroom pizza without mushrooms (i hate mushrooms).i did not notice too long of a wait for our food, it wasnt instant but the same that you would get from any other restaurant. cant complain.when i got the dish, the portion was pretty big. on the first bite, it was just the right crispiness and texture and it tasted great. it definitely not cardboard pizza from my school cafeteria. i wanted to save room for desert so i got half of it in a doggy bag. the  waiter kindly did so when we got the desert menu and got to pick our deserts. i ordered a piece of chocolate cake (cant remember what the cake was actually called)it no doubt beats what you can get at starbucks.my only complaint is that, although the food was great, the prices were comparable to what you can get from where im from (canada). most of us who come visiting to the states bask in the dirt cheap food prices and huge portions (no wonder why everyone so fat!). the portion sizes were pretty generous from what i am used to and the prices ARE what im used to. so it wasnt that much of a disappointment.to sum it up, come to this place if you want polite and professional staff, great food and cute decore. dont expect to get a pie in the face or soggy pizza or that other stuff. didnt see any of that. came with an open mind and came out thinking more good than bad. also, i didnt see amyi would come here again if i didnt live a thousand km's away. maybe next time im down and in the area"
2014-11-02,CzV4FlITtTjnq8dyiXiGkQ,"I wish I could give them 0.5 star! The food was ""Meh"" I could whip up a TV dinner and it would taste the same honestly. But the worst thing was the service and overall atmosphere. The male owner (husband) was a bully!! I really didn't enjoy my sandwich much, but I swear I was way to afraid to say anything!! He kept giving me this ""look"" (I can't describe it really) and it just made me feel like I needed to eat fast and leave. I would HIGHLY recommend that NO ONE goes there to eat, I know it's mean but it's the truth. The food and stress isn't worth it."
2013-06-28,DLKlsZJ1Z7Y9iEnpEtPDpQ,"I never knew about this place till I saw the Kitchen Nightmares show. We drove down from Anthem just to check out the drama. (Un)fortunately there was none, just good (dare I say GREAT) service, and good food!The price seemed crazy high for a chocolate mousse pie (I think it was around $10 for the piece), but it was perhaps the best I ever have had. The only problem is I finished it in just a couple bites (probably 250 calories per bite, but what do you expect?!)We had the Mediterranean pizza. It was good, not great, but plenty good to not complain about it. Yes, it was cooked just fine--no raw dough. Not nearly as good as some of the other pizza joints in the Valley like Spinatos yelp.com/search?find_des…), but very good nonetheless.Sammy, the owner, was watching everything like a hawk. He had the waiters and bus boys moving around like a drill sergeant would. They seemed slightly scared and insecure. I probably would not have noticed it had I not seen the show, but because of the show I was on heightened alert. I wouldn't want to be one of their employees, but as a customer, I liked the attention I received. I probably had my water glass filled 10 times.The big question is, would I go back? Hmm... It seemed over-priced to me being outside of Old Town, but the food was good. I don't think I would make a special trip, but if I was ever in Old Town and in the mood for an excellent chocolate mousse, I probably would.If the prices came down 20% I think I'd go more often, but now, maybe just once a year."
2010-12-17,DQ79kTU_H8Wq8K3vEbzdFw,"We've been to Amy's a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  Samy is always there to greet us, and Amy is always there doing the cooking.  Before ordering anything, check out the bakery display so you can plan to save room for dessert.  Then try the hummus or olive tepanade on the flat bread.  The latter is the same as Amy's pizza crust, which is not your traditional pizza crust.  Neither thick or thin, but very tasty.  If you like it, consider ordering a pizza.    You won't be sorry.  I like the asparagus, prosciutto, and goat cheese as well as the fig, pear, and prosciutto.The pasta dishes are also excellent.  I like the lobster ravioli, the asparagus ravioli, the pesto gnocchi and the penne bolognese.  My wife likes the squash ravioli.  The portions aren't huge, but Amy gives you plenty of sauce, so you can take the extra sauce home to put on your own pasta tomorrow.The place is not cheap or fast, but the wine prices are reasonable, the food is high quality, and both interior and patio seating first rate."
2014-08-05,DkFk2rMTAea5ZSDka_aOTw,"Awful food. Awful people. If I wanted to see crazy I'd visit my family. People should stop going to simply experience the madness. After wasting my money, yes Amy I'm out to get you. You and your husband are awful people who serve shit food. The worst pizza on the planet. The only people who should be more ashamed than you are the people you pay to write good reviews. Your food, and your place are vulgar."
2014-05-18,DrZRd701Y9qDx62LFC1X4w,"Vacationing in Arizona and just stopped in to ABC for a quick dessert & coffee after a long day on the road.  Of course,  we had seen the KN episode, and were anxious to see the place.  What a pleasant surprise!  Sammy was truly gracious and helpful, and Amy came out of the kitchen to chat.  It was afternoon between meal services and they couldn't have been nicer.  We had excellent coffee, delicious desserts, and a great experience.  Only gave it 4 stars because we didn't have a meal....but I would definitely be back to try it again!"
2010-08-04,DyejokcqogJkUo3AD5iJsQ,"My husband and I took our family to eat here tonight.  I had never heard of this place, but due to all the publicity, we had to give it a try.  The food was great, not sure what ""Joel"" was talking about when he said the prices were high, it's not Little Caesars home of the 5 dollar pizza and 5 dollar quality (no offense intended to Little Caesars).  You get what you pay for at Amy's.  When we are in the neighborhood again we will stop and eat here again.  Anyone remember how successful the ""Soup Nazi"" was?  Keep your chin up Amy!"
2016-11-23,E-ECjHKMb3hlEdWzrmJcJg,"I wrote this once before, but they took it off. They refused to allow me to stay there with my autistic son- despite the fact i paid for a product. Not a lie, and absolutely true."
2016-06-26,E4VC0wUlEsMcq7tW6MlzpA,"Was in Scottsdale visiting a friend and we stopped by here for a bite to eat. Possibly one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The owner (at least I think he was the owner) came out from the back of the kitchen and almost assaulted another patron for complaining that his meal was frozen solid in the middle. The couple quickly left the restaurant and we had a chuckle at this odd behavior but waited for our pizza. When our pizza finally came it was AWFUL! Growing up in NY I am a bit of a pizza snob and let me tell you, this barely passed as edible. It was cold, the cheese wasn't fully cooked and looked like it might have actually been a microwavable pizza. When I asked if they could heat it in the oven for longer they copped the biggest attitude and made us wait for 30 minutes. Absolutely terrible! Eventually we just got up and let after leaving a tip for the waitress.I honestly thought I might have been on some type of reality TV show, that's how insanely BAD this place is!"
2014-01-23,E6Awug96P3POnHy2PiTr0Q,"I've eaten here twice over the last 6 months.Not sure why I came back a second time, but won't come back a third time. Food was lousy, service was horrendous. Very rude.Oh well, plenty of other places to eat next time I'm in Scottsdale."
2014-05-17,EI33AuWo7qc_a3hitjhqKA,"I wasn't impressed at all with the food, the service, or the atmosphere.  The silverware was dirty, the glasses had spots on them. The plate was chipped. Had a pizza. The dough was undercooked in the center, dry and bland.  The toppings weren't fresh. Mushrooms looked like they sat around for a week. Never got a refill on my ice tea. Price was high and left me feeling like they're trying to push this place as a high-end bistro, except the food and service were more like a fast food joint. Didn't have dessert because everything in the case looked like it had been there for months. It didn't look freshly made so I stayed away from it. I won't be back. I wouldn't suggest this place if you asked.   It's not good."

I can see where people might think their costumer service is a little harsh, the husband has a lot of energy :) you can tell he has a very kind heart... I would defiantly  go back.  ( and yes I went there cause of the show, but I didn't want them to know that ... But they called us out and it was a little embarrassing.... I wish she did not ask that's why four stars) and the place it self is very clean and nice :)"
2016-06-27,EvgUl04tnhaEBuZXK5bryw,Most awful place in the world the food was disgusting and the owners got mad at a customer for wanting his salmon cooked more!

I have never been treated like i was that afternoon.The dessert was Cream Brulee' (sp) it was to die for very good to say the least! I just learned that this place was actually on Kitchen Nightmare as i was watching a marathon of the show. knowing i had been way prior to the show, i am kinda in awe that i picked out a place that one day will be featured in a show. I will say the place looked incredible on the inside spotless isn't even a word to describe it. Just my thoughts on it"
2014-11-09,FSlLcfSnEMhYQSV-mXS1Ig,"CLEARLY any of the good reviews for this restaurant are written by the crazy owners. I honestly ate here before seeing Kitchen Nightmares and then after seeing it, it made complete sense.  It was awful, seriously the worst food I've eaten and it took forever and we were kind of in a hurry. Any other normal restaurant could have served us in sufficient time and we would have had time to spare. After seeing Kitchen Nightmares,I can visualize Amy sitting at get computer for hours and days writing BS good reviews."
2013-07-02,Fc_D-qKdOjt5hcvxifKFCQ,"""scary that people like this can own a biz; sad.  Gordon Ramsey, you owe me money!  Your show made my cousin want to go here!""Also why is it that everyone that gives this place a great review always starts by saying they aren't a paid spokesperson.  Who told them to say that? We know the owners wouldn't get people to put up great reviews. no way lol; bizarreForget the criminal records and shady pasts of the owners that would make the Soprano's look like a smurf's episode.  That's bad enough; so let's review the restaurant. My cousin is a fan of Gordon Ramsey's show and she wanted to go here.  I was on my way home from a biz trip so I went to visit her and I reluctantly went. It was as bad as any restaurant I've ever been in. We ordered sausage and pepperoni pizza and it was really greasy.  It took forever and we started laughing about it and it obviously didn't please the male owner.   The crust was cooked on the bottom but the topping seemed wet and under cooked.  I ate one piece and didn't want to risk it. I read where the female owner stated that she made the desserts when in reality a bakery makes them and she serves them.  With the reviews of fruit flies on some of the desserts, I didn't want to risk that either.   I personally will never go there again.  These are two arrogant, narcissistic and paranoid people who have no clue to what they are doing and how to treat people properly.  Until they realize that the problem is them, NOTHING will change.  I'll never spend a dime in this place again and I should kick my own ass for allowing my sweet cousin to talk me into going. Positives:Staff was very nice and attentiveNegatives:Food was badUncomfortable place to be in especially with an owner that is staring at you thinking you are going to get him or something.Years ago when I started a business I realized it was all about the people I'm helping and not about me.  Until this business gets that, nothing will change."
2015-03-07,GAvIc4qxe_gVmz--0oZ7XA,"I was in Arizona visiting friends, I thought it would be fun to visit Amy's Baking Company, we ordered a ""simple"" sausage and pepperoni pizza, some ordered salad and one ordered a burger. As for the pizza, we should have ordered from Dominoes the salads tasted like it came from a salad bar and the burger was horrible. The only thing that was good was the desserts. Don't waste you time or money going for dinner, get fast food and pick up desserts here on the way home."
2017-02-24,GHXUkoQbxjs4cBCl4ubkNw,If I could put zero stars I would. This place is DISGUSTING. Do NOT waste a penny in there. Amy is a bitch and I really hope this place goes under.
2013-05-21,GIyyj_hqd6itFiu7tGKbqg,"I went because I was curious to see what the hype was all about.  It is just that HYPE,   I've never been so rudely treated, and not by the staff but the owners no less.  The food is pedestrian and unimaginative as the faux baked goods are dry, store bought and ""doctored""  Apparently I was not so ""special""  as I noticed they treated other patrons as well as their own staff in this appalling manner.  It certainly would behoove the owners to realize that the culinary universe does not revolve around them and to learn what customer service is before they lose their customers.  The ones that keep their doors open?  Drive on by, a greasy spoon is heads above this place."
2014-10-31,GPO1FIrI_5OZBvyf39rwgg,"Honestly, I think many of these reviews are bull***, some of these people probably haven't been there and they are just writing based on the drama they saw in the show. My husband and I went for a wedding in Phoenix and, of course, I had to see the Amy's Baking Company because I am a big fan of Kitchen Nightmares.THE SERVICE: Sammy was really nice, asked how our day was going, he put us on the table and took our orders. Actually he took care of our table (there were more 4 or 5 tables with people, not full).  I was impressed because I thought he would be rude, angry... but he wasn't, at all! He seems to be a simple old man... He took a good care of us, came back many times asking if the food was good, if we needed anything else. He was not, at all the crazy man I saw on the show... really.FOOD:Yes, I have to agree that the sandwich I got was not good, I mean, it was OK, nothing special... I can make a better one at home. I think she puts too much oil on the bread and makes it too way grassy. I ordered a Prosciutto Panini and a cake which I can't remember the name...but it was really good. Seriously, the cake was divine! My husband got a humus ( I think its garlic humus) and it was really good. I should have gone for that one too. I regret of getting that sandwich.... He also got a iece of cake, it was a chocolate and some brown filling... really good too. As I said I was impress....in a good way. Nobody gave me a bad atitude, I didnt hear anyone yelling and Sammy was very nice to us."
2011-09-09,GQSxEycnXrgU4e2dBjyhoQ,"Had dinner there again yesterday and it was as wonderful as our previous times. The Fig Prosciutto, Pear pizza was amazing. They have a special salad with a Citrus Honey dressing that I love as it isn't too oily. Added to the mix we had Champagne and came away raving.

2015-01-06,GZCTrBeWjBAMhGDwx4PFMw,"I'll start off by saying that I came to Amy's Baking Company with a bit of trepidation. I felt like, as a tourist, the couple wouldn't appreciate an outsider showing up just to see that restaurant that was on Kitchen NightmaresI was HONESTLY scared to go into the place, fearing that Amy and Sammy would hate people like me. Man, was I ever wrong.As I entered the restaurant Sammy kindly greeted my friend and I and told us to pick any table to sit at. He promptly brought us water and was SUPER friendly to us in every way. He gave us two menus and invited us to check out the desert display.As we looked at the desert display Sammy walked us through what each plate was. He was calm, and articulate and very knowledgeable and PROUD of what his wife could bake.We ordered a peanut thai salad with chicken (not exact name, sorry) and a panini (again, sorry, don't know the exact type)The plates arrived promptly and both were beautifully plated. Sammy ran us through what was in each dish again as he presented it. Sammy also bragged about the quality of the food (which was great! Talk up your food if you are proud of it!)The peanut thai salad was . . . pretty damn incredible. I'm a big ol fat guy, and the salad filled me right up. The sauce had a bit of a bite to it, which I loved, and was tossed with just enough sauce to make me happy, but not wanting more. The flavor was spot on, and the entire plate felt fresh and easy to eat.The Panini (which I snuck a bite of) was also fantastic. Crispy on the outside (as it is grill pressed) and gooey and warm on the inside. The cheese was beautiful (I wish I knew what type it was) and the side salad of arugula was coated in a very light dressing which was super tasty and did well to hide the bitterness of the arugula. Both dishes were ten dollars each, which in my opinion is a steal.Then came the deserts. A Peanut Butter chocolate cake, and a coconut chocolate cake. Holy shit you guys. I was really stupid to try to finish my entire LARGE salad, because I was almost too full to enjoy the amazing deserts. It is pointless to try to explain how great they were. Just know that I'm a big fan of sweets, and my bar has been now set dangerously high on chocolate based cakes. Thanks for ruining me for life Amy. I'll have to visit Phoenix whenever I want to feel happiness again.Sammy at one point caught me taking pictures of my food, and came over to encourage me to post about the food online. He, again, was nothing but kind to me and my friend.It was weird. I felt a bit bad that I had come to the restaurant expecting to see caricatures and instead was met by two very kind and polite restaurant owners. I'm sure that others have had other experiences with the couple, but I cannot speak to those experiences. Both Sammy and Amy were proud of what they could do, and they SHOULD be. Their food was incredible.Both took the time to take pictures with my friend and I and talked to us for a few minutes about the drama behind the Ramsey episode.I would love to visit ABC next time I am in Phoenix. Come for the possible drama, stay for the incredibly priced TASTY food. If you do not pick up a desert, you're an idiot.Also, if you are going to go to ABC, don't be a prick and harass them just because we have turned their lives into a circus. The horror stories that those two told us were pretty grim. At the end of the day, they are still human beings. Give them a chance to surprise you."
2013-11-05,GbBc4v-ov79fZMfJCFzO6g,I tried the pizza and it was completely undercooked. My wife ordered the burger and it was a soggy mess.I also think the desserts are being bought from somewhere else and brought in.I won't be returning any time soon.
2013-05-22,Gj6y0LW-UGWFKGvDm_FKxw,"This is by far the worst restaurant ever.  Sammy and Amy are so rude.  I ordered the burger and it was undercooked. I tried to send it back to have it cooked a bit more and they told me know.  I will never go back to this place. Everyone, please save your money.  Mcdonalds has much better service and a better burger than these guys."
2013-12-22,Gl9XFtwFgIifENxZKqRSfA,"Candy Bar pie is wunderbar!  Chocolate mousse was OK, but the Candy Bar pie, wow!  Too scared to order pizza.  But think it a great place to stop for coffee and desert after the movie."
2015-10-28,GmkE_YdZQQYPL4jbF84LFg,"The one time I tried to eat there we drove 45 min out of our way because I wanted to try the desserts that were supposed to be so good.  Went during normal business hours but it was closed with a sign that said ""will open at 5 PM"".  If you say you're going to be opened, BE OPENED!  this actually happened about a year ago but they removed my original review because they said it was against the user agreement because I didn't actually eat there.  Well, I sure as hell tried!  It's my fault they aren't opened when they say they will be?!?!  Glad it's closed"
2013-12-02,Gq5XjIzwrW1ULWBu7V8aiQ,"I had a very good experience here.  The food was very good (flatbread, hummus, pizza and carbonara pasta) and Samy was very warm and friendly with us.  We had 10 people in our group and it seemed everyone enjoyed their food and they all said they had fun.  We had reservations on a Saturday night and didn't have any problems.  Samy was very patient with us and didn't mind that my friends and I spent 25 minutes chatting before we ordered appetizers.   He asked my name once and called me by my name the entire evening - I give him points for that.Here is what many people don't understand, Samy is an old-school guy from Israel.  These old-school guys from the Middle East are very passionate, loud and animated when they talk about something important to them.  I never watched their episode of Kitchen Nightmares, but he seems like an okay guy to me.  However, I can see how others may view him as crazy when he gets into a heated discussion.  Just keep in mind he is from a different culture.  I don't have anything to say about his wife because we didn't talk.  Samy just introduced us and I said ""hi"" to her.I hope other people will give them a try without bias."
2014-04-15,GqTUg79-li7xA-HIkPV_VA,"We had the Pear Gorgonzola salad and the Vegetarian Pizza. The service was quite good, although there were not too many in the restaurant at the time we were there. The salad was fresh and well prepared.   Presentation could have been better, but as for taste and quantity, it was more than good enough. The pizza was hot when served. The sauce had a good flavor and the ingredients again were fresh and tasty.  The crust was quite good.  Very light dough, cooked crisp but not burned. The servers kept my water filled but were not oppressive in their service.  The owner was quite nice, and even brought out Amy after finding out my wife's brother was had insisted we try the place.  They were both quite nice and engaging.  I'll come back and try them again next time we are in town."
2013-06-15,H5dkC0OmZkRDTFjN4nrMxw,"I went to this place after seeing the video about it on Youtube in May of this year (2013). I can say that I ordered the same burger as Chef Ramsay did, and it was pretty much an identical experience. The burger just leaked out juice and was completely soggy/wet and overall disgusting. It has become evident to me that these people did not learn their lesson from Chef Ramsay, and sorry to say, I will NEVER come back here in my life. We saw both the husband and wife from the TV show, and while they did not act arrogant like we had seen on the show, the food was just downright gross.This woman needs to take a moment to reflect on the situation. I don't think people are ""out to get her"" as she thinks, but whatever school she went to, to learn to cook, was obviously a joke, or she failed her classes. I can cook a burger better than her on my BBQ. These people own a pretty fancy kitchen and couldn't bother to deliver a quality burger worthy of the price. IT WAS PRACTICALLY RAW!!!Do yourself  a favor. Avoid your curiosity of this place, and just stay away. I think they are getting a lot of business from being on the show, but it's not worth your money wasted honestly. If they had any ounce of self respect and honesty, they'd change things, but it's clear they haven't. Avoid this place, save your money. Much as I hate to say it, but Red Robin can make a killer burger compared to this place. The cook needs a reality check and needs to get a clue, and quick before her husband dumps her and realizes she's swindled him for a million bucks to open this place, without knowing how to actually cook.Update 6/18/2013: I have been contacted by the owners via Yelp, threatening to file a lawsuit against me unless I remove this review. These people truly are insane. I will not be removing this review. Bring on your lawsuit. I'll be waiting :)"
2011-07-26,HMF3GtYL9aa01DEHm6ww7Q,"Sammy and Amy makes this the place to eat  at any time!  Not only are they warm and friendly, they make you feel a part of the family.  The food is unbelievable!  Amy's pastries are melt in your mouth and every dish my friends and I have ordered and shared, was beyond our expectations, so delicious and fresh!  This is the place we go every Sunday!    Do yourselves a favor, go to Amy's Baking Company,  You won't regret it."
2014-03-06,HN8Q02EBxgS0D7U-okfybA,I cannot believe I wasted my time coming here. We ordered 2 appetizers and they were undercooked!! When I told the waitress that we didnt like the appetizers she went to the kitchen and the owner came out yelling at us that we didnt know what good food was. I was like dude are you seriously yelling at us right now because we didnt like the appetizers we asked for our check for the drinks and he got very upset and when we left he yelled at us never to come back. Never in my life have I experienced such disrespect. I had my 2 year old son with me and all the yelling made him really upset. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!Someone named Samy Amy B messaged me and threatened to call child protective services for spreading lies have screen shot of the message. Very sad.
2014-10-14,HYNuLqPfzCXTg2J94arHjg,We went to AMYs Baking Company last Friday with my parents.The owners were so cordial and sincere on making this an enjoyable  experience.And it truly was!Service was great and the  food was excellant!Can't wait to return. So ignore all those negative reviews out there and try it for yourself.I live in Scottsdale and work in Scottsale and I only wish Iwould have come here sooner!You will not be able to resist the heavenly desserts displayed so beautifully!
2014-11-19,I2EK5JeCXzFg6SFgVThSag,"We went for dessert on a Saturday night.  The key lime pie was delicious, complete with small slices of keylime.  The chocolate and peanut cake was good but so rich I had trouble finishing my slice.  There is a gluten free option but what would be the point of dessert?Sammy was a nice guy and treated us well.  The restaurant was clean and well kept.  There were only a few other patrons in the place."
2014-05-03,IQnWaKJt1MhRtDcRFTr2kA,"First, let me start by admitting that I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, and didn't expect to have a good experience when I arrived at Amy's Baking Company.  I was wildly mistaken.My girlfriend and I made a visit to ABC last night for dinner. Right when we walked in, Sammy cordially greeted us and invited us to look around before we were seated.  I was surprised at how personable and down to earth he was.  We decided to sit outside on the patio, because of the design it was secluded and spacious at the same time, and had relaxing, unique music playing in the background.  We love to sit on the patio at restaurants, and although the weather didn't warrant it, we were also glad to see they have several fans and misters for when we get deeper into the summer.Our server was also pleasant, and we decided to start with a few drinks and some flatbread with spinach and artichoke dip.  I had read that someone was upset that the bread had to be purchased separately, but given the amount of bread they gave and how tasty it was, I felt like it was absolutely worth the cost.My girlfriend ordered champagne, and I excitedly ordered the Vanilla Bean Vodka after finding out that the Vodka is homemade.  The glasses were unique and we enjoyed our drinks while taking in the ambiance and relaxing music in the background. The flatbread was almost a meal in itself, and we took some home.  On that note, it was really nice how the waitress offered to box it up for us immediately, as she did after our dinner and dessert.We had asked Samy what he recommends for a pizza, and he suggested the Fig Pear Prosciutto.  It did not disappoint.  I especially loved the caramelized  onions.  The sweet and savory combination was a perfect blend.Finally, I am not really into sweets, but given the reputation they have for having exquisite desserts at ABC, I had to.  My girlfriend was delighted that they had flourless chocolate cake, and I chose the German chocolate cake.  Both were delicious.We're still in a shock of sorts because of how low our expectations were coupled with the absolutely excellent experience we had.  Samy and Amy were pleasant people, and their food and restaurant are exceptional.  We went from being hesitant of going because of what we had seen, heard, and read to having one of the best dining experiences we have ever had.I really do watch Kitchen Nightmares on a regular basis, am a big fan, and have gone to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.  At the same time, I admire how Samy and Amy have sustained amidst the criticism and backlash and am happy that we gave it a chance.  We'll definitely be returning again soon!"
2013-05-25,ITLmxNULDWz9ZE126wPv0Q,"As we all know, the limelight has turned its blinding gaze upon the now infamous Amy's Baking Company. Excited about the antics my friend and I were sure to encounter, we decided to take the trip to Scottsdale and experience the drama for ourselves. Instead, we found a welcoming environment, brilliant mood lighting and music, exceptional service and a satisfying meal.Our server did a wonderful job making my friend and I feel as though we were the center of every ounce of her attention. Frequent check ups and a friendly demeanor made us feel right at home. Sammy himself made a stop at our table and made sure we were satisfied.To be entirely honest, as he approached our table, a part of me anticipated an awkward exchange followed by a heated confrontation. Much to my surprise (and my delight), Sammy seemed genuinely concerned with the satisfaction of my friend and I as well as the other customers in the restaurant.As my friend and I walked out of the restaurant, we couldn't help but gawk at the assortment of desserts the front counter. Unable to resist, I went ahead and bought a chocolate crème brûlée and took it home. This dessert is easily among the top 5 best desserts I've ever had. Overall, our restaurant experience was very good, my friend and I were pleasantly surprised. If you're apprehensive about the restaurant, at least try the desserts, you will not be disappointed!"
2013-09-17,IeB-V8dVokU-9a6XidVXUw,"Undercooked pizza, just like the hells kitchen episode...didnt bother returning or anything, but after seeing the show, and trying in person..worst place ever."
2013-07-08,IepV8FI4Le4nm_DAufG3Dg,I came here during a business trip. The food looks good and tasted good. My colleagues didn't like it but I don't blame them. The food is specialized and you either love it or hate it. The only thing I hated was the waiting for my food and check.My advice is to try it once and make up your own mind.
2014-04-15,IhFfqrcpIUrz7LTgYXAJJQ,"I tried this place on a road trip years ago. I found the owners charming and colorful, so it was a shock to see them being disparaged. I would recommend these treats to anyone. Delicious! Amy & Samy, I wish all the best for you both. I'm so sorry to see you guys are suffering death threats."
2014-03-06,ImqnI6Q1qNjxjwP4AE6RhQ,We went hete for dinner after the movies. As we were walking In some customers walked out very angry and some old man who we Found out later was the owner was telling them to f-off.We should of took a hint and left but decided to stay since Italian was on our mind.We ordered some fig pizza...it was soggy like a noodle and tasted gross. It also took 42mins to get. We mentioned it to the waitress and she took it back to re heat it but it took another 20 mins. So we decided to take it home before we got it back and the old man looked mad. Won't ever come back but will recommend it to friends as a joke or prank..lol.
2014-07-03,IsYxiCJSKVXFiick8Qq6eg,Worse pizza ever!  My friend had a burger that I wouldn't feed to my puppy.  Dough was raw and the owners are rude and ignorant.  Server  was great and apologetic.  I give them 6 months tops until the doors close forever.
2013-10-11,IyXT-8WRDxGUr6kcljJTiw,Worst pizza you will ever have! Do not go here! The dough was not cooked and Amy is crazy! She came out of the kitchen just to yell at me. What a nut job!
2014-01-31,JKfWUAl-YzzXxTnsIZdbrA,"Went there while on a golf trip. Horrid pizza that was wet in the middle like the dough was from Jewel. Burgers could have had a chance if they hadn't microwaved them them to melt the cheese. When we complained at one point a older woman named Amy came out and berated my co-workers , then alternatively hit on me while my girlfriend looked on. They offered us a dessert which we declined as it looked like it was just taken out of it's wrapper from the plane I had just got off of. Steer cleer. But then again I don't think there is any good food in Scottsdale or Arizona for that matter"
2014-02-15,JTH1lw2g2Jzc99oIXrupEA,"My husband and I just had dinner at Amy's Baking Company, the food and service was fabulous. We will definitely be going back."
2013-12-28,JUTEMoCo6tFKaROHBjHc_w,"Was in Scottsdale on biz, had lunch here.Started with the Creamy Artichoke & Jalapeno Dip, followed with the Warm Spinach Goat Cheese, and then the Asparagus Pizza. Finished with a slice of something, but can't remember what, probably cheesecake since it's what I always get when I eat out.Food was great, service was good, but I thought the prices was a tiny high. Maybe it's just Scottsdale..."
2013-09-30,JdT47cft-8KepE6Aq1nfww,Worst place ever...I'll never return here again...thought I'd give it a try but what fail...I fear getting food poisoning if I were to come back.
2014-06-13,Jd_imMQbARuyzB1u7ycoYw,"First off, the food was not that great. I had the pizza which tasted very dull and greasy. I did not have the chance to meet sammy or amy, kinda disappointed. I don't recommend coming here, because they want ""tourists"" to come in and see how bad the place really is. They treat their customers and employes like trash."
2017-12-30,KK1cHqo2734jOmKW-kssDA,Amys is the worst place too go too so glad they closed down the food was terrible and the pizza sucks smh and sammy is a horrible person also who yells at ppl i walked out and didn't even pay
2014-04-28,K_1lqJTEJmzpYV__6cwfGw,the sweets are probably the only thing even remotely worth anything at this restaurant the food is just gross it tasted like microwave meals smh ... the place itself if nice but between the gross food and the uptight aura of the place its a no go for sure
2014-08-05,K_jxrTDilwtVrYSeEi1K2Q,Wish they shipped desserts because they look delicious & I'm a huge dessert fan! Called Amy's Baking Co. & actually spoke with Amy who was super sweet & told me she has a cookbook coming out soon. I wish Amy's Baking Co. the best of luck & I will be in Scottsdale soon & will be stopping in
2013-07-27,KcYphrbzgt9bKlcL4sjJnQ,"Samy was super nice, engaged everyone, and wished them well, probably to make up for the show...We only had dessert - the cookie bar dessert - oreo crust, chocolate ganache, caramel whipped cream and toffee brittle.  It was very delicious but maybe too sweet.  Service was very polite and prompt.  Samy seemed a bit disorganized (we sat next to the register) and there was some confusion at least a couple times in the 20 minutes we were there, but that's for the servers to deal with.Amy was in the kitchen, I wish she was working in the front, since that's why we came.It was almost completely empty for a Saturday night at 7pm.  No wait to be seated!"
2013-10-07,KovT6k5cONbg3_7Am7Nt1g,I tried this restaurant with my husband and another couple after watching Gordon Ramsey's show... Expecting the worst we went there mostly for entertainment and not great food. We were pleasantly surprised! The herbed flat bread was delicious and only $5 - a great value. All of our meals were delicious. Sammy was super attentive and welcoming. Amy came out once to a table by us to fix an issue with their food... Both were nice and our server was very nice too. We would go back!
2015-02-27,KrQYQg2-dM1ACasAUIdgNA,"Horrible service. Out of towner who was hungry. Got more drama than food. Asked for her ""famous"" pizza, but it was undercooked. When I told them, they lashed out. They didnt tell me to get out because they are probably bankrupt. They told me it was ""perfect"". What a bunch of idiots!"
2015-02-10,LGVxU2m0jebINWInGfwGDg,"Mediocre food but the owners were very friendly and accommodating to us and other patrons. They seemed extra harsh on the staff, but that's not for me to judge. At least they are not the craziest restaurant owners in town. That title goes to Italian Grotto."
2014-09-13,LNLt9_7KGxW4Uy_V7sXdnA,"This was neither the best or worst dining experience I have had. I am a restauranteur with three restaurants (Italian, Greek, and a Steakhouse Pub) in the second largest city in our state. I am a CIA trained chef and have a BA in Hospitality Management...suffice it to say, I know food and I know the restaurant business having worked in the industry 18 years.The wait staff were pleasant and engaging. Samy stopped by to touch base with us once before the entrées were served (it was my wife and I) and once during the meal. The salads and entrées, while neither excellent nor horrible, were merely adequate. We did not find ourselves engaged in any drama, but did witness an episode of what I would call poor customer service between Samy and a party of three diners two tables away. I have dealt with customers who definitely were NOT 'always right' in my time, but have always managed a gracious conclusion by comping drinks or sometimes eating the whole check just to bring the exchange to a close. That is a built-in cost of any successful restaurant. Unfortunately, should they try again for a reservation, we are usually too booked to accommodate them....any day...any time.I must admit the desserts were tasty. If I could fly them in freshly, I would put a few of them in my own Italian and Steakhouse restaurants.So, in summary...the food rates a 3 (salads and entrees: 2 & desserts: a solid 4) the wait staff a solid 4, the ambiance (AKA ""floor show"") a 1, the service flow and wait times a 2. This averages to a 2.5, and although we did have spotty silverware (hey, it happens), the dining room was airy, aromatic, and clean. This was definitely worth .5 stars. As such, 3 stars it is...we would return to try it for ourselves but would not make it our first recommendation for European dining in Scottsdale."
2012-06-27,Lj3mBmAeOCf-G3-D2H-_lA,"I went here a few weeks ago with my sister for lunch. It was not crowded at all, and actually we were the only ones in there. The service was great, everyone was super nice and friendly, and the food was even better. The prices for all of the food is great! We split a salad and a pizza and it was only $15. The food is real authentic Italian and I would recommend it to anyone! I will definitely be going back!!"
2015-04-27,LlXQ13MxNOjOFx5fJOVRJw,Awful food and Amy and her husband were very rude to me and my family. I tried a salad and the lettuce was brown and slimy. My wife had the chicken dish and it was dry and rubbery. When I complained the husband told me I could take my business elsewhere. He then proceeded to cuss me out when I demanded a refund. Won't be back again.
2015-03-07,Lt_1PULDEgsqfMpZOSnJRQ,"I don't know what all the drama was about with the food being ""sub par.""  Me and my wife stopped by here on our way through Phoenix, AZ and we happily ran a bill of over 100 bucks.  We didn't mean to but we kept ordering from the menu because the food we had initially was pretty darn tasty!  I started with the Blue Ribbon Burger and my wife had a pizza for starters.  We also ordered an appetizer but I forget what it was called but it was delicious!  We also ordered some cheesecake slices, about 4 of them to be exact.  We ate two slices in house and took 2 slices to go.  It was the darn good.  We were in fact met by Sammy and greeted by Amy as she personally brought out our pizza to us. I sincerely recommend people try the this place out and try to put what ""reality tv"" displays before you judge this restaurant.  If I was local to the area I would happily become a regular to the restaurant."
2014-07-11,M8-aYln0B-Plr1Sp5Mloew,"This place is horrible, I sent back a salmon burger to get another one that wasn't dry and he told me to pay first, I told him I wasn't going to pay until I get another salmon and he yelled at me and said ""No, you pay first then get the F**K out of here and don't come back! His wife (the chef) heard the yelling and came out and said ""just because you don't know what salmon is"
2014-12-04,MMKWxFEJWPcs1NPxDG-9GA,"amy, with your attitude you will never never grow no matter how good your food is! your attitude will kill you! after what i saw on chef ramsey"
2013-10-31,MWSb7oJAsCdkZ-owvSwCfQ,"My daughter and i moved to Scottsdale from Chicago recently, and stumbled upon Amy's Baking Co.  I wouldn't call myself a ""foodie"", however, I know good service and good Italian food.  (years of fine dining.. ex was Italian..whatever... ) Day 3 here in Scottsdale, we decided to try a couple different things  on the menu- hoping for leftovers- (empty fridge at home.) We ordered- BBQ cx mango pizza, Margherita pizza, Pear salad, warm spinach salad-  And wine!  The seating outside is nice-even though its a parking lot view- you soon forget.  The atmosphere is lovely.  Food came with precision timing- and was delicious!  Our eyes were bigger than our appetites, and wanted to save room for dessert- we wrapped most of the pizza for home and had creme brûlée  for dessert.  Excellent.  (the pizza FYI, isn't the same the next day- its just so fresh!)  We met Sami and Amy- they were warm and friendly, welcoming us to AZ.  The dessert is 5 STAR, food is 4 star, and staff, atmosphere is 5 star.  People next to us had burgers- and made comment as to how tasty they were.Days later, i found out about some controversy with a reality show and Amy's baking Co.  I find it hard to believe-  they were very nice!"
2014-06-28,MhB-210m2RIOrFV7D8shaA,"Absolutely DISGUSTING. I was visiting a friend in Arizona, and thought it'd be cool to eat there for lunch since I saw Kitchen Nightmares. I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it wouldn't be as bad as the experience I had. I ordered the blue ribbon burger and my friend ordered the garlic chicken mushroom pizza. It took forever for our food to come, and our food was definitely not worth the wait. My burger was undercooked and complicated, and my friend's pizza was undercooked and doughy. The owners were loud and angry, which is why we did not make a complaint. The restaurant was clean and looked nice. But sadly, it's food was bad, and the owners were worse."
2014-11-10,Mi6BmVQ082p3VqAXyTbhcg,"My husband and I have been here twice while traveling , and, not only were we happy with the food, but we found Amy & Samy quite charming. I think too many people on here are trying to start drama. Give these guys a break....the food is quite good and we plan to go again!"
2015-04-27,Mlib_n1XeU4NndLeJPb3NQ,"We went after watching the Kitchen Nightmare episodes. Samy worked the register, took our order & served our food. Amy worked in the kitchen. When I first got there I said helloto Samy & Amy came flying out of the kitchen when a puss on her face & hands on her hips. Not very friendly at all.Samy tried hard to be pleasant but you can tell it's not his nature. 4 out of 5 of us enjoyed the food.I had the Asian peanut salad. I thought it was excellent. I was hoping for a little more crazy but ended up with good food."
2014-12-05,MmLZmlsC7HY7miT2j7IhCw,I ate at this place when in town for a baseball game the food was not that great. I asked the  man standing at the  register to take it back and he started talking shit. Then the cook came out and started running her mouth calling me a hater. I didn't understand why they were going left field on me and my party. After a few words were exchanged payed for the shit food and left what a joke of a place to eat. I will be sure to tell everybody I know in that town not to go there.
2013-06-02,MmaNGC-TYkBZtHEhgiFRKg,"I see Amy and Samy must be hiring people to give them good reviews. I don't care how well they improve their food and service, they lost all respect from me when I found out they were stealing tips. Thieving jerks don't deserve to be in business and I would give them no stars if I could."
2014-02-14,MuyTKpzrmCa8koY-whcMYA,"Best dessert ever!!!!!  Beautiful quiet place. The owner is so nice and welcoming, focusing on my every need. I had the blue ribbon burger. Very good. Going back for my 3rd time tonight."
2011-09-25,N5AsRpLaAkIzzFRMJPqKBA,"Just had Brunch with my family at Amy's Baking Company.  The service was welcoming, efficient and timely.  Our girls ordered the pasta and devoured it.  The owner happily accommodated my husband's vegan diet and prepared a special, delicious sandwich with yummy fries.  But the highlight of our meal was the Croque Madame.  It was outrageous!  My husband told me my eyes rolled back in my head when I took the first bite.Can't wait to go back."
2014-01-27,N7cvCNLlMC67s1GCj59UFA,"This was our own personal experience at the now infamous ABC's in Scottsdale.  Like everyone else we watched the episode of a Kitchen Nightmares, and that very night I told the hubby if we ever visited Scottsdale we had to go, so we recently have been in Scottsdale, and decided to go for lunch after church.The restaurant is in a strip mall type of place, but the restaurant is gorgeous, spotlessly clean and has a very European look to it. Samy was in the front of the house, and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We did and Samy promptly arrived and gave us menus and we ordered a glass of wine for me, and beer for the hubby.  Samy brought them to us immediately.  I started with a bowl of corn chowder, and it was piping hot and delicious!  Obviously very fresh and homemade.  Hubby ordered the egg salad sandwich and I had the Pasta Rustica which is chicken, andouille sausage in a sweet/spicy sauce over penne.  The entrees took awhile to arrive but Samy explained that every entree is freshly prepared to order to keep the quality of the food to Amy's standards.  We didn't mind waiting.  While waiting, Samy asked us if we had seen the show, and we admitted we had.  He told us not to believe everything we saw, and to judge the place by our food and service.  Both our dishes were really great, and my husband said the Egg Salad sandwich was the best he had ever had.  It was served on one of Amy's handmade burger buns which he also said was super yummy.Amy came out of the kitchen to thank us for enjoying her food so much.  She and Samy gladly posed for pics (which I have posted), and when we were leaving Samy reached into the dessert display case (all the baked goods looked fantastic BTW) and gave us a free chocolate dessert which said ""Love"" on it.The service and food were excellent, and I hope people can give these folks a chance, and go and see for yourself.  When in Scottsdale, in the future, I will gladly return to ABC."
2014-07-08,NN62EGrnOwkU1sx-_NCPvw,"One of the best place we ever eat in! We travel a lot and tried many places across the country. Looking at previous negative reviews I have to wonder if they are about the same place we had our lunch in today. The place is spotless clean and cozy, nice ambient and music. The high chair for our son was the cleanest one we ever seen in a restaurant. The food is fresh and tasty, with a wonderful flavor combining French and Mediterranean cuisine. Our 1 year old couldn't stop eating the hummus and bread. The prices are fair for the quality of the offered dishes (there is no place offering a generous sized humus dish for only $5, not even in the Middle East where the price is almost double).Useless to mention that desserts were to die for. Service was perfect, attentive and tending to all our needs. Definitely a place we will visit again when back in the area."
2014-07-06,NQWRgoDwGBv3v2iKqXg8oA,The desserts were delicious! we got the chocolate mousse and the candy tart and both were to die for. I love the decorative glitter on the desserts. They were beautifully made and had so much flavor!
2014-01-03,NRUgRX3kUqjWVHN93hK_ZQ,"Terrible food, terrible service. Deeply suspect that the owners had their family fake good reviews."
2016-11-21,NTq3XPLK5OYuxjAz6P44-g,This place i have been seeing the ones from Gordon Ramsey. I think that he is right because he knows whats right and knows whats best a restaurant and i will keep it like that. With that being said I think this restaurant is not the best I went there before and I hated it. The place was clean but the couple was dullutied. And was the worse place to ever go.
2014-05-14,NYjiC1XPH6vcTaoZXNLZTg,"I ate here for dinner with my husband.  We are visiting Scottsdale from Chicago and we had a fantastic experience.Both Sammy and Amy were very sweet and accommodating.  Our food came out in a timely fashion.   Sammy asked us how our food was tasting every time we got a new dish (we got drinks, an appetizer, entree, and dessert).  Really great service and they obviously really care about their customers and their experience.All of the food was so good!  I absolutely LOVE Italian food and this is the best italian I've had since I got to AZ! We got the flat bread for our appetizer and it was nicely seasoned and garlicky!My husband ordered the Sweet and Spicy Pasta Rustica.  My husband LOVED his dish.  I got  the tomato basil gnocci and it was delicious!  The home made sauce was so good!We both got dessert and it was very rich in flavor and taste.  It was a very sweet ending to a great experience. Overall the ambiance was nice and the prices were reasonable.  We will DEFINITELY be coming back!"
2012-05-20,NbkLuNmVHpWIlmw3vPYb8A,The pizza and salads were fantastic. Fresh ingredients in the organic salad.  The pizza is our new favorite.  The owners are very friendly and really care about what they are serving.  We had creme brûlée for dessert and it melted I our mouths.
2014-05-11,NmnCa-JOapk5FkIYzHGoSA,Some of the worst food ever. When I complained about my undercooked pizza I was told to leave. I'm sorry that I don't like my pizza uncooked. On the bright side it's really clean inside.  If you want bad food and crazy people go try it!
2009-10-04,NnMN10F4wDuBKv25vCqcCg,"For more than a year Amy's Baking Company has stood empty. Periodically the faithful would drive through the parking lot at the N.E. corner of Scottsdale and Shea, craning their necks to check for signs of life. It was a pilgrimage. And finally we've been rewarded. We thank our friend Anna for calling us with the good news.In the time before Amy's closed it garnered glowing reviews from the likes of Phoenix Magazine and the Arizona Republic. Everyone mentioned the upscale decor and the friendliness of chef Amy Bouzaglo  and her husband/host Samy. But mostly they raved about the food - especially the desserts. I'm more than happy to say that nothing's changed, or maybe it's even better. They've added a pizza oven and a long list of designer pizzas. The dessert case was full of cakes and tarts, some of which seem to be new recipes.We ordered fried calamari with a pesto aioli ($10 ), and the hummus platter with wild mushrooms ($10 ). I asked Samy to take a piece of chocolate-orange-raspberry-truffle cake out of the refrigerator case so it would warm to room temperature while we ate our dinner. The calamari were tiny rounds, very tender, lightly breaded with seasoned crumbs. The aioli was delicious, I could have eaten it by itself. But the real hit was the hummus. It's texture was perfect, and it was most thoughtfully seasoned. A very large helping of sauteed mushrooms sat atop. But what capped it off was that it was served with a pizza pan full of Italian flatbread (which is also used for the pizza crust) fresh and hot from the oven, blistered and crunchy. It would make any topping shine.While we ordered from the antipasti section of the menu, there's lots more to try. Salads, like Caramelized Pear ($12) and Vanilla Bean Coconut Shrimp ($16).Sandwiches: the MonteCristo ($17) is a house specialty, dipped in a French beignet batter and served with homemade raspberry preserves. Butternut squash ravioli is one of my favorites from the pasta selections. And then there's the pizza: fig, pear and prosciutto ($16 for a 12 inch) is my next must-have. While the prices may strike you as on the high side, the portions are big enough to share and the ingredients are top quality.Then, the cake. It's time out of the refrigerator case had softened the buttercream and accentuated the flavors. Amy is master of the buttercream - it's never overly sweet. The play of orange and raspberry was intriguing. We also shared a ""creamy iced coffee"" ($4) which went perfectly with the cake. Choosing a dessert isn't easy. Everything looks beautiful - lemon curd tarts, cupcakes, bread pudding, cheese cake, creme brulee. Now that Amy's back we can try all of them.A note: Amy and Samy will be serving Thanksgiving dinner. There will be three seatings, and reservations are being taken now. You'll find us there."
2013-06-08,ODvEpaMZ-gCDKJ8xsaKiHw,"I took a trip to see some friends that live in Arizona and while I'm waiting at the airport to fly back, I'm writing this review. This place is in serious dismay. Me and three friends walked in all sat down in a very clean well put together room that looked very professional. We were actually very impressed with the appearance of the room. Do not let the looks fool you. Our waitress was very kind and periodically would come back and make jokes, give us water, compliment us. So far, fantastic.The food I ordered took, and I kid you not, 2 hours. 2 hours to get two pizzas. I asked the gentleman at the counter about the time frame of the pizzas and was met with only a subtle hand gesture and ignored me after that saying I was only waiting for 45 minutes tops. The food we got was honestly the most undercooked pizza I have tasted. The crust was crispy but the inside was seriously frozen dough. I went to the counter to ask for another (completely with a very calm demeanor, I have worked retail for over 7 years I know how to ask politely) and he shouted at me worse than I have ever been yelled at. A very aggressive woman came out after hearing the commotion, and i kid you not, after waiting for food for two hours and asking incredibly politely to have the pizza cooked some more, and began to say how I was the scum of the earth and how I should ""eat the dog food I was use to eating"" I refused to pay the bill. If you ever see this restaurant avoid it at all costs. Never. Go here. Terrible people."
2013-07-11,OPN-dDUBkH7uH-G8nOnskg,"Came here with an open mind, with a group of 9.No appetizers were ordered.I personally ordered the fig and proscuitto pizza... and OMGIt was delicious!!!  Really good... so good that I can confidently say I'd like to come back just for the pizza.  I sampled a few other people's food at the table, and I gotta say, I was impressed!We ordered a variety of desserts, and I was able to sample the chocolate mousse as well as the key lime pie (I'm allergic to nuts, so I wasn't able to try them all)... and OMG again!!So good!!!The server was good, though she did seem a bit defensive. I'd come back for sure!"
2015-05-03,OSHnMqPh8Z0Uk2cJAq7P0w,"I went for lunch today and had the best turkey and cranberry sandwich. I took a dessert to go and it was amazing. Samy was gracious and kind and it was great to see that the owners are at there restaurant working, that is what makes a restaurant successful. I can't wait to go back and try another delicious dish."
2010-08-21,OX-tXbLwiwBRxV8vIJMIkA,"The owner (a gentleman) met us at the door and was overall very friendly, at first.  He seated our large party right away and between him and a waitress we each had a water and were able to order drinks immediately.  That was where the great customer service ended.  I ordered a whiskey sour and was brought a Manhattan.  Not even CLOSE to the same type of drink.  But I accepted it anyway.  We were a little astonished at the prices of the meals but figured they would be larger portions so everyone decided to split meals.  We were wrong.  One of the items ordered was the butternut squash ravioli that cost $22.  There were *4* average sized ravioli's on the plate.  When the lady that ordered it asked if that was really the entire meal the owner mentioned how it was a million dollar restaurant and the food is expensive to make.  Sorry, but 4 raviolis do NOT cost that much to make, and most people don't care how much you paid for your business.The pizza's were average sized, but burnt.  The pasta plates were way over priced for the small portion you received.   The owner wouldn't split the plates for us, he told us he would bring us the food out and we could divvy it up ourselves. We sat there chatting for a while waiting for him to acknowledge us again so we could get our (ridiculous) bill and leave, but he refused to acknowledge us again until I finally called him over and asked him for the bill.All in all, I will never visit this restaurant again, will never recommend it to anyone and if anyone asks my opinion, I will tell them to go ANYWHERE else."
2015-03-19,OejuU4KH5GAqEKa768DDLQ,"My family and I were in Scottsdale on spring break. We had eaten dinner at a brew pub near the Shea 14 movie theater. We wanted some dessert so my youngest saw a bakery in the same complex as the theater. We walked on to get dessert, sat down and I got this very surreal experience and immediately realized we were in a restaurant that had been on Kitchen Nightmares!  Remembering that Gordon had loved the desserts we got the flourless chocolate cake and the creme broulee. They were fabulous.  Whatever other issues there have been with the food I can't comment on, but the desserts are wonderful. I think most of their diners must be as a result of the episode because Sammy asked us a couple of times if we had googled them, and encouraged us to do that.Surreal experience, certainly one that our family won't soon forget."
2014-03-25,Opqe0pyB2H_bEocrGu9ZKw,"If you believe that the witch er I mean Amy, makes all the desserts and yet puts out crappy food, you're seriously delusional. Yes, it is possible that some people are better bakers than chefs, but not in this case. For one, she would never have time to sleep if she was always baking, with as many desserts as are in the case, then cooking everything from scratch as they say during the day for the customers. If you give this place 5 stars then you are obviously related to these two or you lost all your taste buds in a tongue accident. I stopped in recently on my way through Scottsdale on business and ordered a ""7.5 ounce"" not 8 ounce burger with white cheddar. Who the hell serves a 7.5 ounce burger???  I ordered it ""medium"" and it took 35 minutes to get  medium rare along with some burnt fries that were raw inside. Are you serious? 19 dollars for a burger and fries? If I was at a nice restaurant that would be fine, but not this place. Of course the entertainment value here might just be worth it to try once. Maybe Amy should offer cooking classes since she seems to think she is the best cook to ever live. If you hire a real cook, I might just come back here, but otherwise never again!"
2014-01-11,P60G1Scw0KE9ivwtczypAg,"I came in here after all the buzz and find out for myself and it is grooooooooss. It tasted microwaved, if I wanted frozen food I would've gone to Walmart and microwaved a stouffers frozen lasagna myself! They are so rude and the employees look like hostages I feel so bad for them. These are terrible people and they don't deserve to have a business, will never come here again even if it was free."
2015-02-24,PFzFoFrnXAptik2BNjoSVQ,Over priced for cheap quality food that they serve. You can feel the tension when you walk in the place not a good feeling specially if you wanna have a relaxing dinner. And the tension isn't from the customer because know one wasn't there.
2013-08-10,PLMfqkYhHPjl4cPJzil3Og,1. horrible service!!! 2. overpriced!!!! 3. cold food!!!
2014-02-15,PbolZ1RY9bhE6cP6b2rVFA,"Dessert only! The food is over-priced, probably because they still need business. Ramsey came back but I refuse to eat anything other than dessert until I see the changes. $8 for a Créme Brulee is just pushing it. The menu looked rather large still for such a small place and small kitchen. Samy was nice and I enjoyed his sense of customer service. He greeted us and served us and even entertained us! I'll stick to the delicious desserts even if they are pricey. If I were you, I wouldn't return until watching the new episode of Kitchen Nightmares on February 28th. It's a 50-50 wait. By the looks of the Facebook page, Amy seems to still hate Ramsey. This is why I don't think it will last much longer..."
2013-08-22,PtDHX4TVwVLxReWjGKwbLA,"I killed sometime before a movie I ordered a chardonnay it was served prompt good service and I bought a awesome ""I speak feline"" t-shirt with a portion of the proceeds going to the Yarnell fire department... I did not have time to order any food so I can't do a write up on it, but everything appeared to be good..."
2014-07-12,Pxres8jn4eFK9ccbI6m3jQ,Great experience. The owners were extremely friendly and made sure to meet our needs. There were 11 of us and right away they made us feel very comfortable. We all had a different dessert and were very pleased. The staff all were flying around the restaurant making sure everyone was taken care of. I can't wait to go back and try their food.
2014-11-30,PziL4v6JWrh6jvV9y1GpJg,"Amazing ! Amazing!! Amazing!!! Absolutely one of the best dinning experiences I have had.  The food was excellent and the service was great.  My entire family had a great time, I had the salami panini which was delicious! Then the crime brûlée and coffee finished everything off, it was excellent.  Samy snd Amy are amazing people and are now our friends."
2015-08-18,Pzq9vaTy1lZpZNM__Ar6QA,"I visited Amy's. Absolutely the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant. It was all pre-made, pre-packaged garbage. You should shop in the frozen food section of the grocery store before going here."
2014-02-28,Q368eGRAxUNAH2Ez0Whd_w,"I ate here yesterday. I waited 45 minutes for a great pizza. I saw the guy at the front counter stealing tips, so I gave mine straight to the waitress. She looked scared and tucked it quickly into her apron. I wanted to tell management , but had too many other things to take care of. The desserts look pretty so they get an extra star."
2014-02-04,QAIQHm_swC-g40Hzoj2qvw,"We went there and were greeted by the owner who seemed nice. The food was ok but when we were leaving we saw some beautiful glitter covered cakes. The owner said his wife makes them. Since at the time it was our child's baptism we decided to order a cake. That's when we started having problems not only were we told we couldn't have what we wanted our message on the cake to say or have a cross because it was against their religion. So Amy agreed to do a small cross and the message ""blessed with our miracle from above"" which was a good comprise when we got it it said our miracle and her name nothing else! So I guess that's the way they try to make their customers happy and it wasn't the cake we'd originally ordered it wasn't at all. As if it couldn't get worse but the cake was literally frozen inside and we were charged twice the amount we were quoted by the owner. So the whole experience seemed shady and we never returned. Why agree to making a cake for a catholic baptism if you're not going to try to make your customer happy. The quality was horrible we were stuck serving a frozen cake to our guests. Then charge us more for something we didn't order and the owner acted like he was giving us a good deal. Totally felt like we were taken advantage of:( ps) I'd give them two thumbs down more if if I had more thumbs:("
2015-07-12,QV9Zl5mC40qh86IMOHKH7w,Glad they are closing.   I ordered pizza and was under cooked.  I returned it and was yelled at.   I just left
2014-06-20,QuA9_McXPrAoE8ntUoUM2Q,"Went in for lunch today and was a pleasant experience.  Atmosphere is really nice and the owner was a gracious host.  Ordered the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza,  and the crust was one of the best I've ever tasted.  Pricing is a little high,  but it's Scottsdale."
2015-05-09,QzTLl8k-dlTE_FqCrVS9Qw,"So me and friends ate here for my birthday. And what an amazing time we had!! Sami was polite and very friendly and Amy was amazing as well!! The food was spectacular! We had an amazing time. And for the haters out there, give this place another chance! It's worth your time and money! You won't regret it!! Keep up the good work Amy and Sami!!!!! The food was amazing!!!"
2015-04-09,R11MceGcutm7ZGqrPK6ERA,"One word: incredible. There is absolutely no reason why this restaurant shouldn't be packed during all hours of the day. I've watched the kitchen nightmares episode and let me tell you first hand, that's a completely different restaurant. The food was delicious, service excellent, desert magnificent. Give this place a try. Just go in with an open mind it'll be a great experience."
2014-04-21,R16pd5LXN-M2wn2o9_1Raw,"Just visited Amy's Baking Company and Bistro. The Hummus and flatbread were great. The desserts outstanding!Amy and Sammy were delightful. This was a birthday treat for a friend and myself which turned out to be awesome!I really think that most of the negative reviews are totally unfounded and seem to be a nasty personal vendetta against two small business owners who are trying very hard and successfully creating exceptional food.My advice? Don't listen to all the negative nonsense hype and try it for yourselves. You will be pleasantly surprised. The menu items may be a bit pricey but considering the location, overhead, cleanliness of the establishment, and the quality of the food, it is understandable. I have eaten in Bistros all over the world and this one is a local gem.Again, try for yourselves."
2017-04-04,RF2Kucr45jv943Zp3FZNfQ,This place is horrible!!!! Food was so greasy. Worst food I've ever had. Honestly McDonald's make better food then this place.
2013-08-27,RLbmRYBBLo44ZBjN27IdAw,"Was down in AZ visiting friends last week and they suggested Amy's cause they heard it was on tv. Sammy took our order prompt but the food still took forever to arrive. I ordered the blue ribbon burger and they both had the the fig pear pizza. The burger was just gross i could not get myself to swallow the bite. My friends pizza was not cooked, seriously, the middle was raw. The waitress cringed as we sent the food back. The desserts looked good but with the food the way it tasted we didn't want to risk it. Needless to say my friends and I will never return to Amy's.....I've had better food at truck stops sad to say."
2015-03-19,ROIXp_02aKasQQAdC9TQcg,"Yesterday I went with a friend and had the Artichoke dip...man the bread they serve with it is incredible!  I also had the curried chicken sandwich, my friend had the walnut chicken sandwich.  Both were delicious!We had the bread pudding to finish but I tell you: any of their desserts are 5-star so you can't go wrong with any of them.Everything they do appears to be meticulously prepared with fresh ingredients.    They are also sweet people and I felt like I was receiving old school service-- attended to at every step."
2014-04-18,Rf43XPCJl_GYhwBbsm8L_A,"wanted to try this place because of kichen nightmares, I don't always believe everything on on reallity TV shows. It was every  thing Gordon Ramsey said it was. Waited forever to get my food, the pasta was frozen bland tasting. My pasta was still cold in the center so i returned it and that was when i was attacked. amy came out and said i was wrong she check it before it went out and i was crazy . Never had any problem at any other restaurant returning anything. Just a overall bad experience"
2015-01-24,RkQx11CfnuSP9-6YsnmIHw,"I was in the Scottsdale area on business this week and after seeing the Kitchen Nightmares tv show about this place decided to check it out for myself to form my own (and fair) opinion.  This was a couple of days ago, but as I recollect back from my visit I decided I owed Samy and Amy an honest review.  I went in with a friend who lived in the Phoenix area who had never even heard of the place.  We arrived near closing time.  It was just Samy, Amy and someone they were chatting with inside.  Samy greeted us at the door in a friendly manner and asked if we were interested in dinner or dessert.  We said both and he apologized that he had just shut the kitchen down for the night, but we were welcome to get a dessert, to which we were fine with.Samy showed us the HUGE selection of desserts which actually took us a few minutes to make a decision on.  Samy explained in detail what each dessert was and every single one of them looked amazing.  We chose the chocolate with peanut butter cake as well as the cheesecake.  My friend got a coffee and I got a soda.While we were waiting for the food to be delivered to the table (which only took about a minute) we noticed how flawlessly clean the entire place was.  I remember on the show Gordon Ramsey was remarking about how the kitchen itself was amazingly clean, and that obviously extended into the dining area as well as the restroom which I used.  It really is one of those places where you could ""eat off of the floor"".The desserts arrive and we sampled each other's.  Both desserts were absolutely delicious!  Quite possibly the best desserts I've ever had.  Just phenomenal.  In addition my friend said his coffee was excellent and likewise the Coke I got came from a machine that was clearly perfectly calibrated and had good water filtering on it.Furthermore as they had let the wait staff go home by the time we got there, Samy's attention to us as a waiter was spot on perfect.  He seemed to know exactly how to leave us alone to enjoy our food, but not for too long before checking up on us.  There is nothing worse than a waiter who ignores his customers or a waiter who simply keeps coming by asking if everything is ok.  Samy was spot on.At this point I'll say that yes the tv show made the food look bad and it also made the service appear to be bad, but we did not experience even a hint of ANY of that.  Reality tv shows are often heavily edited to make things appear worse than they really are in order to initiate drama because drama sells.  I have to wonder just how much editing and provoking off-camera was actually happening.  For all we know the entire customer base on the day they shot that episode was all hired employees of Kitchen Nightmares told to go in acting as customers to provoke Samy and Amy.  Regardless that is only speculation because I've no involvement with the tv show, nor have I ever met Samy or Amy before in my life until last night, but what I CAN say is GIVE THESE GUYS A CHANCE!  Either the restaurant used to have major problems and they have since fixed them, or Ramsey's show misrepresented and twisted things around for the drama and to gain tv ratings.  My guess is it was possibly a little bit of both, but that doesn't change my 5 star review in the slightest bit.  My entire experience on Thursday night was flawless and I couldn't recommend Amy's Baking Company any higher.This will ABSOLUTELY be a stopping point for me any time I am back in the Phoenix area.  Likewise my friend was so impressed he said he is going to start bringing people here as well.Samy and Amy, thank you for a lovely dessert and excellent service.  I look forward to having dinner with you soon.And Mr. Ramsey, I must say the ridiculously overpriced steak I had at your restaurant in Caesar's Palace last spring was dry and bland.  I didn't complain because I was with business clients, but THAT experience was a rip-off."
2014-01-21,Rz8ztX702z8B3rj29gCFRA,"My girlfriends and I walked in for the first time and we had an excellent experience! I wasn't sure what the fuss and the negativity was all about other than some bad publicity from a reality show. But as a customer, all I care about is great food and service. We ordered spaghetti, caprese salad and the fig pear proscuitto pizza- all were absolutely delicious! Plus, the owner who was also our server was very attentive and respectful toward us. Even when we were clearly done eating, with my leftover pizza in a box, he refrained from bringing us the check right away seeing that my friends and I were in a deep conversation. I love this kind of  personal service that enhances your total dining experience! Next time I will be bringing my husband in for a date night and trying one of their amazing desserts as well as other menu items!"
2013-09-24,S3NWS43tDdUBB3hWQaeeWQ,"Gordon Ramsey WHO????Saw the show and we decided never go here. WE were soooooo wrong to think that way.This place is AWESOME!!!We were greeted promptly and offered a booth. The server was very attentive and made some wonderful suggestions such as starting with the Flat Herb Bread.Well worth the $5, it was the size of a pizza and cut into those type slices.Oh My Gosh - rarely when dining do we have a first bite reaction such as wow and yet - there it was.This, we thought, must be a GREAT start to an AWESOME dinner.Well, the hits just continued.I had the Spinach salad with mushrooms, bacon and goat cheeseMy husband had the Caprese salad with a huge portion and VERY innovativetastes on both. The Caprese plate also had a side spinach salad with olives, sun dried tomatoes and lemon slices with a great dressing. Yummm just thinking about the blend.I ordered the meatballs which were a good size.The tastes and the sauce were very good. My husband ordered the baked spinach gnocchi. He was in serious love now!!The desert suggestion was flowerless German chocolate cake.Another big portion and it tasted like a chocolate truffle. The frosting and coconut stuff fell off the top, but it was still pretty good. We did meet the owners, Sammy and Amy and talked about the food, the show fiasco and their new upcoming tv adventure. I have been so shocked about how mean and nasty people have been in their reviews of this place. We have been all over the world to thousands of restaurants and this food was pretty damn good. We definitely will be back for more!Give it a go and you will as pleasantly surprised as we were."
2013-12-31,SB7j0KHScUp8WA2Irk17_Q,"Ok. I will disclose I was just the 'pick up' person for a call in order. Yes--had heard all the stuff and the person who sent me has left a one star rating. They wanted me to give my opinion on service as (I will also disclose)...I do in home care and SERVICE is what it is all about. Based on that.....how hard could a pick up be. -Order was ready but---they took their time to bag it up.-No offering of 'anything else' such as condiments.-No thank you---even after they saw I left a tip! (maybe two bucks is not 15% but, it was a to go order)"
2014-05-28,SJmbreizA9O4c3jNt6wmww,Surprisingly great visit.  I took my step-daughter last weekend and we had a great time.  Sami was a wonderful host and his wife was gracious.  I will encourage my husband to take me back for date-night.
2014-07-07,SOd0MQua0xs9R5aX_cJ4qQ,"I'm from Southern California, and I was in town for business. I watched ABC on Kitchen Nightmares, and I had to drop by to see what all the fuss was about.The show didnt do this place justice. The restaurant was extremely clean. I wish restaurants here in california were clean as ABC. The owner Sammy was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. I had my dog with me, and he went into the back to bring him a treat. He was extremely nice. The desserts are amazing. Very delicious. I strongly recommend them.I really feel bad for this place. The owners take a lot of passion and care into this restaurant. The restaurant deserves a higher rating, but filled with reviews from people who only watched the show and never visited the place in person. I was caught by surprised how great this place was. I will definitely drop by again."
2014-07-24,SWosAJ9izZbVFt9XZ0ml0Q,Ate there for the first time tonight with friends.  We were a relatively large table and the service was amazing.  The owners were wonderful.  The food was great!  The desserts were both beautiful and delicious.Loved the Pasta Rustica - unique flavor combination that I want to go back again for sometime soon.  We had an assortment of food from the menu and everything was really good.  We had a wonderful experience and definitely plan to go there again if we are in the area.
2014-05-17,S_H0gspdEW-x-EQE5Gcm8w,"Came to visit ever since I saw this place on Kitchen Nightmares. I am a burger guy and typically do enjoy a gourmet burger. Their blue ribbon burger was something to not. Though it was okay, I got my rare when I asked for medium rare. The bread, like in the show, was greasy. You might as well go to five guys and get a burger if you're going to get this. Thank goodness it didn't come with fries or else I wouldn't have been alive to  write this. The truffle oil was okay and the bacon was crispy.Service was okay. I was served by a timid young lady and didn't look like she was unhappy. I could be wrong however. I left a tip but I do not know who took it. While I was here, I over heard a couple across the room with the owner and they were getting into a fit. I couldn't hear what it was about but after 5 minutes, they hastily got up and left. Not a surprise."
2014-04-28,SfYZvdyTvODHg8W3IDJBew,This restaurant is a joke. Food is horrible. Save your money. Surprised they are still open.
2013-09-21,SpbzqXQamWH2EU6CnZakDg,"I was visiting friends in Arizona after moving away a couple years ago. We decided to do some shopping in Scottsdale and have dinner at Amy's Baking Company. The front of the house was beautiful with an array of desserts on display. Sadly, this is where the good experience stopped.  The ONLY positive to come out of this experience was our server, whom I sympathize (I work in the restaurant business). We started off with the Lemon Garlic hummus ($5) only to learn that it did not come with bread...What?? It was okay at best, pretty bland. Immediately after our app arrived we ordered the Pear Salad ($12), 18' BBQ Chicken Mango Pizza ($22) and the Tomato Spinach Ravioli ($14). Our food seemed to be taking a while and I decided to ask the manager/owner Samy how much longer it would take. Wrong decision. He was short-tempered and dismissive, saying it would be ""right out"". A total of 70 minutes and one app later our food FINALLY arrived (the dining room was nearly empty, maybe 4-5 other tables). It was not worth the wait...The salad was fine, the dressing was sickeningly sweet. The ravioli was swimming in a bland tomato cream sauce and I could tell the ravioli were NOT fresh. The pizza was completely raw and the chicken was dry/tasteless. Our server was almost embarrassed for serving us this food, gave us a knowing glance when we told her we were unhappy and removed the food from the table.My friends and I left feeling not only dissatisfied and hungry, but uncomfortable. Throughout our dinner, the ""chef""/owner (wouldn't know it by her behavior) was heard complaining, yelling and picking on her staff. Horrible. We will never be back."
2015-06-06,TDmx5bNjEHd_nIbhE9uUwg,"Visited my daughter in Bullhead city, but love to golf so stopped by for a quick bite. Am a fan of kitchen nightmares but know it's a TV show and can be full of drama.This place is beautifully decorated. And it was busy for a small eatery...the food was okay. They are trying improvements I can tell, but they are trying too hard! Just saying, relax and have fun with it. I got the impression they were too focused on proving Ramsay wrong than just enjoying their customers and their business."
2014-04-06,TFscRV1U6uxeLn6CPp1wxA,"in all honesty, this place isn't as horrible as people make it out to be. i had to try it after seeing Gordon Ramsey rip it to shreds, and I feel like compared to Ramsey's eatery in Vegas, this place is on par, dollar for dollar. Whether the owners are quality people is moot, sure, but the food is passable, even good. i'd say don't knock it til you try it. ramsey is in the television ratings business, first and foremost. Don't forget that."
2015-03-25,TG3GcRx20tAxXxpqn20Lwg,"This is the second time I've been here and the damn restaurant is closed during open hours. I drive from the West Valley, 30 miles to try their pastries since they made such a deal about them! I'm not willing to sacrifice time, energy or money on this crap show of a business. It gives Scottsdale eateries a bad name."
2013-12-12,TSUuC6jrZ2QdMCzlxIbfaQ,"I don't write many reviews, but I feel compelled to do so for ABC.  This is an excellent restaurant.  Beautiful, quaint, and charming.  Sam is gracious and considerate.  I was on an obvious first date and Sam was very attentive.   When my date's credit card had issues, he was as considerate as possible, knowing it was a potentially embarrassing situation.  All of the customer service aside, the food was good.  I had the hummus appetizer (very good) and the flourless chocolate cake (also very good).  Do not pay attention to the 1 star reviews, they are obviously trolls - because there is no way they deserve a one star.  Go for yourself and make that decision yourself. I'm looking forward to going again, and trying more of their menu."
2013-10-14,TVnVQNoEd7noZo1_XMMMyw,"I wish I could give no stars. Amy you're a crazy freak and when the doors close everyone will be laughing at you!!! I stopped by to check this place out while out of town just because of the show! These two are idiots. I tried the fig pizza. Soggy, disgusting and just unpleasant to the eye. The burgers taste like Walmart patties. By the way if you call that hummus you're an idiot! Amy couldn't cook if her life depended on it. Please everyone stop going to see if its actually like the show showed us. They are thieves with no taste buds. As soon as we stop supporting them they'll go away and then maybe Amy can take a cooking class!"
2013-12-21,TiXFkQJptHdLLGhiXmWgKQ,"The food !!!!!!!! Horrible beurkkkkkkkk !!!!!! And the boss And Amy !!!!! My GodThe food actually dégelasse, and the boss completely mad. When the old who thinks to be a gangster :) anything. Crazy and a stupid old man who thinks to be a gangster. Soon finally a real restaurant I hope."
2014-08-01,Tkaxcj9KT4_BgDgafkhjSg,I did enjoy the desserts! Although my blue ribbon burger was on the raw side. I did have it sent back and just to be told it was actually well done. I was talk down on and felt really disrespected! I will inform friends/family that this isn't worth your time nor money to eat at!  Note to owners- if you treat your customers with respect they will be loyal and refer friends and family to your establishment!
2014-10-29,TogKHmIl2lMKkxfKRBV79w,"Nothing to write home about.  Dessert was considerably better than their entrees, but, since it is called Amy's baking Company, maybe that is to be expected. I was surprised that my friend and I were the only diners as it was prime time, but I did feel their entrées - because they weren't very good - were overpriced. Their desserts, which admittedly were very good, I felt were way overpriced. The desserts at Chompi's and AJ's are just as good and much less expensive. If I was looking for a meal, I'd probably opt for Pita jungle which also serves sandwiches and soups that are just as good but at a much more reasonable price.  But I might consider going back for a dessert. This place may be pricey but you don't have to battle crowds as they don't seem to have developed a following yet.  Especially handy if you're trying to make a movie next door."
2014-12-21,TqHKO8lk8dGKMpWB74RRJg,"I have been to Amy's Baking Company twice with my fiancé.  The inside looks very nice and really clean. I have had full on conversations with both Amy and Sammy and joked around with them. They were both really nice to us. The food was really good also. I got the cheese panini and my fiancé got the spaghetti with tomato and basil. Both dished were really good. The prices for the items on the menu were very reasonable as well. On a side note though,  it is $10 for a slice of cake. The cake is good, but I don't think justifiably $10 good...  Overall our experiences were really good. We will definitely be going back there for lunch occasionally."
2014-11-06,TrPa7i6klFJg2PJpXymDRA,"To say that Amy's Baking Company was harshly judged by the internet (and the world) is a major understatement.  The food was not only good, it was spectacular.  The entire experience was exactly that, an experience.  Sure, you could go out to eat.  Sit at a table and ingest food.  But at ABC, we were whisked away and treated as royal guests... almost family. From the minute we stepped in, Samy warmly greeted us and showed us to a table set for our arrival.  There was definite warmth in the decor and ambiance.  You can tell that the owners have put their entire heart and soul into the place and it is a sad fact that a silly television show and some internet bullies could drive a wedge between that and what is a truly wonderful experience for potential customers.I ordered the Curry Chicken Salad, which was nothing short of spectacular.  My father in law ordered the Sweet and Spicy Asian Peanut Salad, which I got to taste.  To say it was delicious is not doing it justice.  Addictive.  That's a better word.  The kids all finished their Panini's without prodding, which is a testament to the flavor in itself.  Words simply cannot describe the incredible tastes that filled our mouths.    And then there was dessert.  One thing that has never been in question was the quality of the dessert.  And it certainly lived up to the hype.  I had the Crème Brulee; the kids had the Flourless Chocolate Torte and Key Lime Pie.  It was at this point that we simply had to applaud the chef.  Amy graciously came out and thanked us all; she seemed genuinely touched that we enjoyed the food so much.  Her parting words to the kids were ""stand up to bullies, stand up for yourself.""  Which I think was a wonderful message for them.       If we lived in the area, we would go regularly.  As it is, we will definitely be making it an  annual trip, hopefully more. These are GOOD people.  And they serve AMAZING food."
2017-08-19,Ts01djmzn7wCQiFyclwhmw,Worst place i have ever been! I waited over an hour for my food and when i complained i got screamed at and threatned. I walked without paying and was chased to the parking lot. This place is the worst i have ever been!!! If i could put 0 stars i would...
2015-02-27,U6ke0KQEMCk7eEBQUxEcgQ,Horrible service and food can't believe this place is still open
2014-05-05,UCnt5yOT6fai9LOzdO3Q6Q,"I don't care what that show says, the food here is amazing.  We spoke with the owners and they were completely nice and helpful.  My leftovers didn't even make it the rest of the night.  Had a late snack cause it was SO good."
2014-05-24,UFq51LFmhfEPn21CM9l_RQ,"We stopped by Amy's to get a taste of her pizza and desserts and they were soooo good.Food - We had the Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza Amazing NO BS one of the best pizzas I have ever had so fresh and a little dab of pesto on top mmmm good ( I wonder if they deliver to Tucson lol )Restaurant- Nice clean and modern Staff- I did see Amy working hard, Sammy very nice (despite what the TV showed) He waited on us, very nice guy. They did have one  server ( this girl did not even look our way she was rude and she can't say she was busy because there was only us and two other tables) All in All we had a nice time and gosh I wish I didn't have to come back home that pizza was soo good!"
2018-06-26,UhC1nWcBH0qO1_bZOX-SMQ,I went here before it closed on while on vacation in wonderful Arizona. The food was mediocre and almost inedible. Restaurant looked nice though to have causal dining. Owners were very rude to others while there. Not very hospitable.
2013-12-06,UlA54TXG_xDtuOX-IraZ5g,"This is officially THE worst place on earth!!! Food is disgusting. The guy that owns this craphole is a duchebag. The ""lady"" in the kitchen is a psycho. We waited for our ""pizza"" for over an hour. I would rather eat a frozen pizza from the super market rather than going back there. The cook is a gold digging hussy and the guy is a delusional jerk that's going to be dumped as soon as the doors to this s**t hole close. To all the staff: run, run, run. You deserve respect and can do so much better. There is NOTHING good about this place!!"
2014-03-09,V1O3ksuv5fMyDxCREjWujQ,"While visiting my sister in law in Scottsdale, she chose our dining for lunch. We were a party, one in a wheelchair. Nice dining room, pleasant surroundings. Terrible service, and terrible food. Our waitress was pleasant, but acted scared of everything. My Son had the pizza, and it was not cooked throughly, we asked that it be cooked more, and was returned 30 minutes later, scorched and burned.This supposed little lunch cost $200.00 plus, and was totally inedible. My husband complained, and was told, he should know what he was ordering before he ordered, and that there was nothing that they would do to rectify the situation.Save your money, do not give to proprietors that don't care about their patrons."
2014-10-05,VAY4baaKEI-XI0iksjlgCQ,Friendly -Clean -great food. Will go back next time we are near. Nice little place. Anyone that gives it a bad review is trying to attract attention to themselves
2013-06-15,VAp8XyPBGImtVkjuVmz_JQ,"I went back tonight and was sad to hear the ""be kind"" sticker had been ruined by a person who maybe needed a hug. Thankfully, just because people can be awful didn't make Amy or Sammy stoop to that level. They were both amazingly kind and my five year old was so happy to meet someone who shares her love of sugar and hello kitty. Maggie says thanks for the hello kitty rings!  Please tell the server ill make sure to mail a new sticker!!"
2014-06-03,VIhWC0rGj7XGZ7P0DQ2V-Q,"We were visiting from Toronto, last weekend.The four of us are travel agents and have been ""wined and dined"" by the best restaurants in the world. We can tell honestly that our experience at ABC was top notch. The pear salad was to die for -  two girls stated that it was the best salad, that they have ever  had.  The Caesar salad was also excellent. The dressing was home made and was an authentic Caesar dressing with anchovies. It was nice that this salad contained bacon, as I have noticed that many restaurants in US do"" play it safe"" (not to offend anyone who doesn't eat pork) and do not put bacon in their Caesar salads, which is a huge mistake and it takes away so much from the taste. The prosciutto, fig and pear pizza was unusual and very tasty. The dough was cooked to perfection.  I loved the carmelized onions - what  a nice touch.The mushroom and chicken pizza was also very good. Samy was very friendly and gave us almost undivided attention (there was a large table, beside us). We were so full and almost did not want a dessert, but we just had to try one.  We had the flourless German chocolate cake - with toasted caramel coconut on top. It was to die for! Amy is a great cook and obviously takes lots of pride in her work.  When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't open yet, so we had a chance to talk to two employees.  They both stated that they are being treated and paid well and love working for Amy and Samy, as they are great people.If you are visiting the Phoenix area - you have to visit ABC - you won't regret it.Thank you so much guys for your hard work and please don't stop cooking."
2013-06-11,VLxNluQZlbQuzmW_nhn2gg,Three stars that's better then they should have. The food is horrible and then they yell at any costumer that complain. This place should be closed down the food is horrible what ever u do don't go
2013-03-19,VaFw3XLaTjtSZwwrk-7XYA,"Went to complain to owner over phone about restaurant about Margarita pizza, was threatened with restraining orders and told to f*** off by Amy herself. Accused of not being real/being a competitor. What an unfortunate derivative of capitalism and family business. I hope she gets her head out of the microwave and stops being so defensive about her bad food."
2014-01-20,VioXHoZjy6pc6W_vHXJGag,Worst restaurant experience. I went to eat here when I was driving thru for a photoshoot I was doing downtown. I ordered a pizza and my assistant ordered a burger. We both can say it was the worst food I have ever eaten because of the meat quality and the dough quality. Simply the worst service from Amy too.
2012-06-16,VqN3Gfacxkb0kG7GYccE7Q,Excellent food and service. The owner and his wife are great people and add such a great atmosphere and sense of fun to the place. Not to mention that they're pizza is absolutely delicious. There is no doubt we will be adding this into our list of places we will be coming back to in the very near future!!
2013-07-06,Vqo9kfb2zFjJfIF2mXRxlQ,"Just FYI, passed by the place on this lovely Saturday night.  There were maybe two people in there at 8:30 p.m.  The gelato place down the sidewalk was a lot more hopping.  You would think with a 14 screen movie theatre directly across the shopping center from them, they would have more business; but the word is out.  I looked at the menu and there were not very many interesting choices.  I'm not sure, just based on reading their menu, why anybody would walk in there in the first place.  Scottsdale has many first-rate restaurants."
2015-06-22,Vts1_b5SvwKHWeV-T_4C4A,"Good news is I had a good key lime pie. Bad news is I called in for a peach pie and they told me they had one. When I got there, he handed me a peach tart. I ended up going with a key lime pie because of last minute timing. The key lime pie was over $100. Just thought everyone should know since I only found out when he handed me the receipt."
2011-06-26,W2PaoKJrySu-imysTF8FEQ,"Last weekend when my best friend and I were trying to decide where to eat I suggested ABC Bistro, and she looked it up online and told me about some of the crazy reviews.  I was surprised, but I convinced her to try it anyway, and she ended up loving it.  She said she'll definitely come back, but she wouldn't have wanted to go there in the first place based on the negative reviews.  That's why I thought I should write a review myself, though I normally never take the time to write reviews of restaurants.  This is actually my first time.  Anyway, I have eaten at this place with different people on four occasions now, and each time, the food has been fantastic.  The pizza crust is so delicious you will dream about it at night.  The pastas and appetizers I have tried have also been great across the board.  I found the owner to be very friendly, and he even offered to put our leftovers in the fridge for us on a couple of occasions while we went to see a movie across the way.  So, I hope people will give this place a chance despite some of the negative reviews out there.  It really is a charming place with excellent food."
2013-10-11,W8iEXWJsmXdnZtpfpICUbA,Ordered the blue ribbon burger.  Over cooked and tasted baked not grilled.  Maybe it was one of the topping ingredients but it had an off putting flavor.  Frozen fries.  E ambience is nice for being in a strip mall I guess.  Won't go back.
2015-02-14,W9ldDihOURIEISZBdvILNg,"Where do I start! The baked goods were deciduous but the food is only so so. When I sent my burger back the owner, Amy came out and asked me why I didn't like it. I explained it was over cooked (I ordered MR) and she told me that was not what I ordered and she was not going to remake another burger for me. I was with my daughter who is only 2 yrs old and was nervous and scared to say the least by Amy's attitude. If you are going to Amy's Baking Comany PLEASE DONT take children. The owners are very unpredictable and will verbally asult  you for the littlest thing. I will never go back even if the baked goods were tasty."
2013-06-04,WNIE_U8SoMCmoJv1VN5-zQ,"Was in town on business...I was starving, but upon exiting my rental car I immediately turned around after witnessing a male worker (older man) screaming at someone as they rushed away from the restaurant. I will never spend my hard-earned cash at an unprofessional place like this...yelling at a customer??? WHO DOES THAT!?"
2013-08-19,WWpj3BatcGhqaPP25eh07w,"The food is actually really good. I think the pricing is really reasonable too. But in the four times my wife and I have eaten here, the guy who runs the dining room has been rude to us twice. It truly is a shame because courteous service seems like it should be the simplest component of a restaurant, but ABC struggles with it.The first time we just came in to get a dessert to go. They were busy. The guy told us they could not serve us. That is to say, I could not hand him cash in exchange for a slice of cake in a box and walk away. That was evidently going to be too much hassle. I was puzzled, but I thought maybe it was a little quaint that he has such a high standard of service for his dine in customers that he refuses to compromise for someone who isn't staying there. My wife and I were annoyed, but also a little intrigued so we eventually gave them another shot. Our next two experiences were quite good.Our last experience we brought our two year old son to have an early dinner at 4:30. We know not everybody loves kids, ergo the 4:30 dinner time- a conscious effort to minimize our footprint on the dining public. This was 2/5/2011, so it was a little chilly outside, but sunny. We requested a table outside since the weather was bearable and we knew out there we would bother no one. The guy insisted we sit inside, since it was too cold out. There were only two other customers in the dining room. I played a YouTube video on my phone to entertain our two year old as we waited for our food. The guy was not pleased at this, and responded by turning up the music in the dining room. I'm thinking- eh, no big deal. He then came to the table and informed us that if we had come during the dinner rush, he would have declined to seat us, gesturing towards my son. Now he has actually changed my frame of mind- tthat IS a big deal.As a parent, I'm not having that. If you're a restauranteur and you make a calculated decision to not welcome parents with kids- hey, that's your prerogative. But if you're a parent, you should know what you're walking into. So parents: even if you show up at an odd time and request to be seated outside, away from the other patrons- they don't want you there. Bottom line, if you are their kind of customer, you will probably enjoy this place. You can tell he has a very old world notion of fine dining into which he is fashioning his place. My personal preference is to be treated well when I'm spending my money, and I am not trying to be anybody's certain kind of clientele. I thought we made an effort to be courteous diners, and they made an effort to make us feel unwelcome."
2015-03-03,WdAdsWPnrTXALjNYSnHexg,"Mom has been taking me to lunch once a week and today she took me here. Having just moved back to the valley after 9 years in the Midwest, I had no idea of the controversy that has gone on here.  We had a lovely lunch. Both Samy and Amy greeted us with a smile and I found them to be extremely courteous, friendly and pleasant.  While my mother noshed on the cauliflower soup (absolutely delicious!) I had a hard time selecting an entrée because they all sounded so fantastic. I finally opted for the spicy Asian salad - it was awesome! The cabbage, arugula,what I think was caramelized peanuts, cilantro etc. etc. but best of all the dressing! Not sure what's in there but it is definitely addicting!  seriously A salad that will tickle your taste buds. It was big enough to share but instead I took the other half home to eat later as I needed to save room for one of the most  Beautiful desserts I have ever seen.  The dessert case is truly a work of art. Amy is incredibly talented and it shows.  Funny thing is I typically don't like sweets however, the Keylime pie looked irresistible and it was! I would have taken a photo but I was too excited and gobbled it up.Bottom line: I had a wonderful experience today and I will definitely be back with friends! thank you to Amy and Samy!!"
2014-12-05,WrgoqB5n4iRzAXsdEtl5Vg,"I travel down to PHX/Scottsdale a couple of times a year to visit my friends and this last time I begged my friend to stop at ABC because I had seen Gordon Ramsey's show and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Once inside, the restaurant was empty, which surprised me since it was a busy Saturday afternoon. The reason I surmise is because of the very busy movie cineplex sharing the same parking lot.  Parking was an issue, but I blame that on the theatre.Samy greeted both my friend and I very cordially and since we were on a time crunch we went straight to dessert. The dessert case was super impressive and the selection was amazing.  We chose a creme' brûlée and a slice of key lime pie - complete with two glasses of bubbly.The desserts were AMAZING. We both walking out very full and very satisfied.  Next time we will try the food.  But both Amy and Samy took the time to come out and speak  with us and were very gracious.  If you are having problems in AZ, move your Bakery to Seattle - it would be awesome!"
2013-07-30,Wv6EJ2ElhEZ--6Tve2wE8Q,I don't even understand how this place is still in business. Everything is well and fine unless you accidentally step on the owner's toes!!Horrible. Absolutely horrible the way they've treated people. Would never come here again based on principal alone. Definitely not supporting a business that devalues its customers.
2014-04-15,Wwd7pSzgsCV2ulcn7RMepg,"While visiting the area, how was I to pass this place up??As Seen On TV® the decor is nice. Food was relatively uninspired, slow to arrive and cold. Service was capable. However we had to wait a long time to see some of the trademark madcap entertainment. Fortunately just before we left another diner had asked some sort of question to the owner which seemed to offend him. A minor shouting match ensued. The cat lady peered from the kitchen but did not get involved. Would have been quite disappointing if we hadn't got to see this.So 2 stars food3 for service-4 stars for owners who don't know that the customer is always right (even when they're not).Maybe they're happy that this place now attracts people for the crazy owner shows. If they're shooting for an Ed Debevic's style they need to get Amy to trot out and shriek or meow at a regular basis. That would get me to go back."
2014-07-03,WyyLaFv9X3VJp95ITBgC9g,"Visiting from Cali, food was NOT GOOD. I had never experienced such a place in my life, and that is not a compliment. Their food made me sick for almost a week. Going there with an ""open mind"" will only cost you money and possibly an entire week in the toilet. Owners really have no concern for their customers. I give it ZERO stars, and hope who ever reads this doesn't make the same mistake I did."
2014-05-15,XLzfsAIBXj4RvWDoj2e_WQ,"It's so obvious that the people who write lousy reviews for this place have never been here and are just jumping on the bandwagon.  My wife and I and some friends went tonight expecting to see craziness and chaos and ended up eating some incredible food. They have a white pizza that was, no joke, the best pizza I've ever had. I'm a fatty... don't take that compliment lightly. I love pizza. This had this savory, almost custard-like sauce that blew my mind.  The desserts are so amazing and rich, they're obviously made with love. And lastly, the owners were very gracious and so sweet. We visited with them at length. Leave these poor people alone already and actually try the food. You won't be let down."
2012-02-13,XY0qJUxaLwn2fyMpqlr2fg,"This restaurant looks great from the outside, and the food I'll admit is delicious. But the owners are horrendous. Not only do they treat their staff terribly (borderline abusive), but I overheard the rather creepy owner telling a customer who commented about the high price of an entree that ""if they want to save money, they can go eat at McDonald's."" I know for a fact that the owner couple overworks their staff, and take most of the servers' tips. I do not support this behavior and will never eat at any restaurant that man opens."
2014-03-23,Xmi9vu5q_AN6C14bAWXGoQ,Terrible people. Will never return. Would rather eat at a gas station frozen food section.  Greasy n raw sum it up.
2013-06-01,XsjlHvD0JO92T3_44Wn1cQ,Visited some friends in Scotsdale... This place is a pos. ate the salmon burger and got food poisoning... Contacted the health department save money go eat fast food
2014-01-04,XyWZUKJKubxX3RDNCmVdRw,Wow it is amazing to me how much people enjoy to complain. This place is actually really good. I went here a few months ago with my sister and a few friends. We are all huge Gordon Ramsay fans. They must have improved things immensely because we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. I ordered the smoke salmon flatbread and for dessert I had a candy bar pie I believe it's called. It was really good and the presentation of the food was very well put together. I didn't meet Amy however. I met Sammy and he was really nice. You can tell he means well and cares about his staff and customers. He even took a picture with my sister and her friends that she of course posted on Facebook. I wish I had it to upload to my review. My sister stayed later than I did (I had to leave to go to a concert). The owner was nice enough to offer to put my food in a fridge until my sister was ready to leave so my food didn't spoil  when I left. It is a little pricey but the food is worth it. My sister also ordered a gin and tonic. He made it very strong which she really liked. We will definitely be back.
2014-12-29,YJd_S4EZphCW4g6EcbkKpA,"I wish I had know about the hype before I went. I would have avoided the place and saved a waste of money. I didn't see any explosive interactions just so odd and rude behavior to those around me. I always keep quiet and keep to myself when I eat, time to think. But the food, where the focus should be, is not worth the time or money. There were only 4 other people and it took 45 minutes to get my food. When it did come it was.... disappointing is generous. Open a can of spaghettios at home and you'll have a better meal. Only go if you want to maybe see a show."
2014-08-04,YRdE_MsmnoFSeBaKsxBUxQ,Horrible food for the price point. The owners are clueless when it comes to hospitality and they're service is sub-par at best. Also there is serious health code violations at this company. The rude management (if you can even call it that) has no respect. 0/5 stars.
2013-05-26,YceEs9aOdX_t5nwl_RmZYg,"This was my first time to this restaurant and I walked out with a full tummy and a smile on my face. The problem with Scottsdale is that it is such a fast paced city that they have forgotten what a genuine sit down restaurant is. This is a place that you come to when you do not have any time constraints and are willing to wait for some damn good food cooked by single chef with some serious talent. Back east, people flock to restaurants like this one, waiting for hours to taste the deliciousness cooked up by one person. So if you are looking to spend sometime with a loved one and want some amazing non-chain made food with lots of different flavors on every dish, then Amys Baking Company is the place to go."
2013-05-24,YgeQs-7e9G-HxAgQhq_edA,"We dropped by this place by mistake really ... I was in the area and being from out of town we were attracted to the plaza as it is very nice looking. As we drove around the plaza we came upon this spot. My go had told me about it so we decided to park the car and go in for dessert. As we approached we noticed that the patio was closed ... A stupid sign on a blackboard read that the patio was closed for security reasons??? Who doesn't open their patio in Scottsdale? It is May and the evenings are very nice and every restaurant in town has more people in patios than in the actual restaurant. We noticed that only one couple were inside. As we approached the front door a young man met us ... He seemed confused. Within a few seconds the owner approached us and asked us ""what do you want, do you want dinner?"" What the hell kind of greeting is that? We were both taken back ... We said we simply came for dessert to take out. He let us walk in but looked very shaken or suspicious. The whole serving staff was smiling for some unknown reason. We approached the counter where the desserts are and no one even came over to serve us. We decided to walk away as the whole experience seemed weird. We asked the owner on the way out if he was open later. He said they were open until 10 or 11. We went somewhere else for dinner as it was about 630 pm ... We later drove by at about 930 willing to give them A try for dessert ... The place was closed and the. Staff was busy cleaning inside. The patio was chained up at both ends. This place is too weird and I'm  not into begging someone to take my business."
2014-05-25,Yik9Fgh0jA6aHQIDvKOQhQ,"Ok. I have to say it was difficult pretending that I had never heard of them or saw their show on television, but I think I faked my way through it well enough. We honestly wanted to see what all the hype was about. Samy was very nice and greeted us immediately upon entering and let us select our own table. He had a big smile and was very friendly and welcoming. Amy was sitting at the table when we walked in looking like she was prepping for her day. The restaurant was very clean and the ambiance was nice. Honestly, the service was really good. Everything came out in a timely manner, nothing seemed rushed and we were checked on unobtrusively on several occasions. We ordered the pear salad and the meatball pizza. Both were really good and the pizza was not soggy!It does seem that staff may be on edge a little as if they are getting people in there all the time to give them trouble, but if your food is good and you compliment them on it, Samy will walk away from your table with a proud, beaming smile and shake your hand as you leave. Honestly, the food was really good, the service was great and we felt appreciated.  Leaving a restaurant feeling appreciated goes a long way in this day and age. Perhaps they may have had some issues in the past, or perhaps the show needed some ratings and baited them for some drama?  After my visit, I am thinking they may have been baited for drama and ratings. I have a feeling you get back what you give when you enter this restaurant and that is normal in life, right?  I come to Scottsdale on a monthly basis for work and I can honestly say I will come back again. They seem like good people who just want to earn a living and have people like their restaurant. Give it a shot with an open mind and I think you will be surprised with the outcome."
2014-01-14,YsM1qDjivZvf-T7BUxS35A,"I visited twice in early December, I went with my girlfriend and her family to Arizona, Nevada and California for the Christmas holiday and in the five days we spent in Arizona, my girlfriend and I went twice. The first time was...pretty bad if I'm honest. We went on a Friday night and like usual, I deferred to my girlfriend for appetizers and drinks. We got the flatbread which was okay and my girlfriend wanted the olive appetizer. I absolutely hate olives so I'm not going to judge ABC at all on them because they could've been the best olives in the world and I wouldn't have touched them. Girlfriend said they were 'good' and ate them all, so that was fine. Paying just 5$ for the flatbread or just 5$ for the olives would've seemed like a ripoff, but it felt fine paying 10 for the pair. It was plenty of food and most appetizers are around that price range anyways, so no complaints. We split the...mango and something pizza. Mango was the 'odd' ingredient so that's the memorable part, I think there was chicken on it too? Either way, along with olives, I hate cilantro and onions, and this was loaded with them. My girlfriend loves all of the above, so I deferred to her since it was a date night. I had a couple slices. It was cooked fine, I just didn't like half the ingredients (not ABCs fault though). However, I was disappointed, more in what we chose than the actual food quality.I vowed to go back a couple days later, because it didn't feel fair judging a restaurant over a bunch of choices I wouldn't've gotten normally. I got a house salad with their house vinaigrette, it was very tasty! Lettuce was real crisp, tomatoes tasted like they were slightly spiced (could be wrong though). It just tasted fresh and the dressing didn't taste store-bought, though I'm not the best with that.I went with the chicken parmesan this time, and the red sauce was absolutely delicious. I had to ask the waitress over to find out what it was, and she said it was a basil red sauce. I could've had that for my beverage. It came with penne and I would've preferred spaghetti but that sauce was so good I just ate it up with the penne. Chicken was cooked fine, no complaints. it didn't detract from the amazing sauce though. Man, if I lived in Scottsdale I would just buy that by the pint as often as possible. When I came back to NC I went to my favorite Italian place and got chicken parm, the chicken was probably cooked a tad bit better but the sauce just wasn't comparable. I'm drooling about it right now.My girlfriend got Gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. She loves Bolognese and she cleaned her plate.I don't remember what the cake we got was, my girlfriend wanted it. It was shaped in a heart and was chocolate. It was tasty but eight bucks. Too small for eight bucks. I preferred to not look at the bill as it was expensive, but that basil red sauce, oh man. 4 stars because it was too expensive. But man if I make it out to AZ again I'm going back to ABC"
2014-07-21,YsQnJL4Bev0mcgcXKZoWPw,I went with  5 other friends three of us had chicken parmesan it was great and pizza was great we talked to Amy and Sammy  we had a great time and will go back again and again Thanks Amy and Sammy
2014-09-29,Z-WXOSIZ3eXnUHd92dQEtQ,Aweful food. Terrible service. I dont recommend this to anyone.  The food is bland and tasted like it was microwaved.
2014-05-04,Z9ueR7CEQpDhCEKbippWZQ,Don't know why anyone would go to this restaurant just based on there horrible service and shitty attitudes.  I would like to who in there right mind would work for them.  Definitely not worth the aggravation.
2014-05-12,ZANdNUJBAl5Cb21sPLUQZA,"The food is just not good, PERIOD! Desserts are desserts. Overall experience was very tense. I had no idea the place was on a reality show because I don't watch that crap. Very unusual energy in there. Will not return."
2015-02-01,ZFCX1pJAMt4-BHfFyhj2vQ,"Worst restaurant ever. I came from Cali to visit a friend and she took me here as a prank. I didn't know what a nightmare this so called ""restaurant"" was. She told me this we were going to a quiet place with amazing food. The sarcasm could not be spot on. I could have made anything we ordered in the microwave and the owners yelled the whole time. How is this place in business?"
2010-08-10,ZFgE6LALDTpd4Z45mkYvYQ,"This place is incredible!  The staff was very friendly, and Sammy the owner came over to talk to us for a while.  You can tell how much he cares about the food and the customer's experience; he even suggested that I get half of the Monte Cristo sandwich since it was a little more expensive.  He reduced the price down for half of the sandwich without me even asking.  $40 including tip for dinner for two and dessert.  Overall one of the best places I have eaten at in recent memory."
2013-06-20,ZRL6bhD0ad-_dEXnqcKfiw,"The most wonderful deserts in the Valley!!! Whether you enjoy them in the restaurant, or, take them home for a special treat, you will not be disappointed. Baked fresh daily, they are rich and luxurious. No one does it BETTER..."
2010-08-14,ZaiNIs1VOR8Ka9d_m92O5Q,"My wife Jane and I took our dear friend Sonia to Amy's Baking Company tonight.  To Amy and Samy, thank you so much for your kindness, generosity, great food and fun!The restaurant was exquisitely decorated, in other words, beautiful.  And, it was packed with smiling faces and lots of laughter.  The background music was relaxing, nice after a stressful day.My wife Jane had the garden salad, Sonia the caesar and I had the French onion soup.  What a great way to start the meal.  The flavors were unbelievable.  Off to a good start, we could hardly wait for the pizzas to arrive.  We did not feel rushed and had a nice break between the appetizers and the entrees.We shared two pizzas, the BBQ Mango Chicken and the Chicken Saltimbucca. (I hope the spelling is correct).  Wow.The combination of flavors is something hard to describe.  Anything I write would not do the food justice.  Simply, great food that has to be tried.We finished off the meal with Sonia having a French press coffee, me with a cafe mocha.  We unfortunately did not try the desserts tonight as we were so full from the meal.  But the dessert display looked great.  A lot of the other diners had dessert, but just no room left for us.  Next time, we will start with dessert and finish with the pizza.We took up the table for 3 hours, relaxing, great laughs, enjoying the evening.Amy and Samy, you have something very special with your restaurant.  You have obviously put your hearts and soul into creating a special place that will please your customers: great food, pleasant atmosphere and courteous service.  We will be back.  It's rare to find a place to dine where you are treated like friends of the family.Customers for life.  And we hope, friends for life.For a wonderful place to eat in Scottsdale, we give ABC Bistro/Amy's Baking Company our highest recommendation.Jane, Sonia, Grant"
2014-04-13,ZbBCuc6xB6UgA3i1YxjT7Q,"I can't really complain about anything. We watched the show; we came in and it was fine. Sammy messed up our salad orders a bit, but he was kind and polite and when the salads came they were great. We also had the ravioli and it too was delicious. It was a tad too salty, but still very good. Desserts were really excellent. Service was good. Sammy and Amy were very kind. Not sure who to believe."
2013-08-05,Zc5dh0i6c7TEPuhJqzuqOQ,"WHY WE DECIDED TO GIVE THE PLACE A TRY:Ok, so I was on a Netflix binge watching Kitchen Nightmares. I watched the first two seasons and decided to search online for Gordon Ramsey. The first result that popped up was Amy's Baking Company right here in my home town of Scottsdale AZ. So, I watched the episode online like and then proceeded to watch all the local news and radio interviews of ABC. Next, I decided to give the place a try for myself before I placed final judgment (something I think everyone should do with the ability to think for themselves).THE FOOD REVIEW:My wife and I went for our Friday night dinner and started with the flat bread... It tasted amazing! It was seasoned perfectly, with Italian seasoning and oil. The bottom was flakey and crispy and the top was a beautiful golden brown.We ordered the same things that were criticized on the show. I ordered a Blue ribbon burger medium and my wife ordered a small fig pizza.There was a little bit of a wait for the entrees but I have never eaten somewhere with this quality of food where there wasn't at least this long of a wait for the entree. When the main course did arrive, they both came to the table at the same time and were perfectly cooked. The pizza crust  was golden brown on on top and crispy on the bottom. There were fresh ingredients and extra stretchy mozzarella on top! I was honestly afraid to try the pizza cause I was figuring there would be a fig paste similar to Fig Newtons on the pizza, that was not the case at all. There were fresh chunks of fig sprinkled on the pizza. It was very tasty and this is coming from a pepperoni only guy. As for the Blue Ribbon burger; I thought the taste was great. The pilled high toppings of cheese, mushrooms, and bacon were great. The burger had a very peppery flavor, which I happen to really like. The outside of the burger was seared to have a smokey grilled flavor and the inside was lightly pink and filled with juice. The only complaint about the burger was the bun. It fell apart on me before I could finish it, but this wasn't a deal breaker for me.I also got the sweet potato fries with ranch. The fries tasted good, and had a great flakey, crispy, outer crust on them. THE PRICE:Everything on the menu is separated. Sammie said this was done to let the customer pick and choose what they want without paying for things they don't want. For example, if you want flat bread with hummus you have to order them separately for $5 each.If you want the burger and fries you have to order them separately. $15 for the burger and $5 for the fries.VERDICT:This is one of the best local restaurants my wife and I have eaten at here in the valley. We plan to make this a regular spot for our dinner dates (it's also in the same parking lot at a movie theater so it's perfect for movie nights). Give them a try before bashing them because of what you saw on TV. NOTE ON THE REALITY TV ASPECT:I personally work in the video production business and have a good idea of what happens behind the scenes at these ""reality"" tv shows. Just like scripted tv, ""reality"" TV needs drama to sell. I do believe that the owner has trouble accepting criticism, but I also feel that many things were exaggerated and egged on by the producers of this show. Even so, these people have been put through the fire and have not given up. They have only made changes for the positive regarding the waitstaff and tips."
2014-06-20,ZyCgGf63rfm-jR3UyRihxg,How is this place still open? I came just to see if what I've heard was true. And the owners are just as bat sh!t crazy as I've heard. Stay away Food...would be acceptable for far less money. But for what they are trying to pull off it's just well below the mark.
2013-11-11,_-PILG8sWbwQ9SzI3cKF6g,Sucks!!! Pizza is nasty and raw... It took over an hour to prepare. Customer service doesn't exist to the owners!
2013-11-20,_0uLoqfzHWEIYPXGSIqKSQ,"A little pricy but I was very content with the quality of the food I ordered (the pear salad). The food was actually tasty: the pear added a smooth alternate to the usual apple I have with a salad. The dressing was excellent and I believe there was a drizzle of chocolate. Unusual, but tasty. The portion size seemed approximate to what you'd expect for lunch. The delivery time was appropriately speedy. It was a salad with no cooked parts, but they did well with respect to that. The presentation was appetizing. Sammy did bring by a pizza which Gordon famously criticized. Sammy announced that it looked great, which is a little unusual, but the fact he said it make the experience a little more surreal (omg that's where Gordon sat! There's the register! Etc). He acted as host and delivered the check (a waitress took our order and delivered the food). I tipped 10$, hoping that it found the appropriate home (I am usually generous with my tipping anyway). Overall, the ""experience"" of what happened on the show still kind of exists, but the food we ordered was pretty tasty and passed the tests of my layman taste buds. I'd return again."
2014-07-11,_8-sxLc56n2YxhDAEYjmJA,"Well, finally went to Amy's Baking Company with my wife and friends tonight and I waffled between 2 and 3 stars. I have to keep reminding myself why I give great reviews and not so great reviews. Our waitress was pleasant. The food was alright and Sammy kept an eye on us to make sure that our party of 6 was attended to. We were the only ones there on this Friday night and had entrees and desert. I'm stuffed as I write this and had to have my entree and desert boxed up. My thoughts, go try it yourself. We all have opinions and my recommendation is that try it first before you Yelp about it. Or talk to people about your experiences. The internet and media realm is a constant moving truck and one never forgets things in this day and age. There was no drama or yelling in the background. Amy and Sammy and the one waitress there thanked us for coming in and the wait time wasn't bad at all for our food. Nothing negative to report here. Time can be a great tell, and time will tell many things. With that, the night is concluded."
2011-03-25,_ND8quP4m8MNa_DWjcQ32A,"This place is awesome. The food is always delicious and the desserts are amazing looking and tasting. I had the lasagna, which I ate the leftovers for lunch today. The pizza is also very good. We were told that they will soon be opening for brunch so I'm excited to see what their brunch menu looks like. We have eaten there a couple times and have not been disappointed yet."
2013-12-31,_Zax8VjSwy9kFSK9WjOU-A,"Customer service is poor -- Food is OK, but not great.  The food is definitely overpriced for the quality you are receiving.  I would venture to say that many of the folks in there are new customers -- with very few of them coming back.  I ate at ABC with a few friends visiting from Italy and Spain -- They laughed at the Pizza taste/quality -- So ABC has that going for them.Parking at night kind of sucks, just like most of the deserts and meals we tried."
2014-04-19,__DmfA99O-1nmDl1y64w9w,"Wow, Amy is crazy. Her husband is scared of her, and I don't blame him or Gordon Ramses for leaving at all!! I told her that the ceaser salad I ordered that took 1 F**KING HOUR TO BE MADE was nt fresh because the lettuce was dark yellow, almost brown and the cheese pizza was black burned. They told me to f**k off! and so I did. They really are P A T H E T I C."
2014-08-02,_bn45BhoHNN6JYeZFcQq3w,"The worse place I've ever  been!  Food is undercooked, soggy, and the owners are incompetent with service.  All I heard is them talking and bashing Gordon Ramsey.Seriously....... Look in the mirror.  This place should be closed!!!"
2013-06-09,_ly9JPBv_gfLHVLVE_2MYw,"The restaurant is very clean, but the food and owners are absolutely revolting. I would rather buy my dinner from a gas station than eat at this restaurant again."
2014-04-22,_oDPhwaDJYuvzhInLapctA,"Ok, unlike some people leaving reviews I really, actually went there. My grampy lives in Phoenix so we made a little side trip. I know that ""reality"" tv is just as scripted and edited as professional wrestling so I had to see for myself.The atmosphere is nice. The restaurant seemed bigger on TV. But they did a nice job with it. The prices were a little higher than I usually pay, but thats Scottsdale for you. I felt like the portions were at least fair for what we paid.We had a mixed green salad with a really tasty dressing and a three cheese pizza. It had a little too much flour on the bottom for my taste but otherwise nothing wrong with it. I liked the tart goat cheese and the fact that it had a bit of pesto and a bit of red sauce. In fact, we devoured every crumb of the pizza, even our daughter who is maybe the pickiest human being that has ever lived.Sammy was attentive and didn't insult and berate us one bit. But then again, we didn't antagonize him. Sometimes being nice to people goes a long way.So what if they order in their desserts? NEWS FLASH: 90% of restaurants do.In summary: stop believing everything you see onTV. I would return if given the opportunity."
2014-12-12,_tHskvxJgLXMpTaxLpCPCw,"My husband and I were driving back home from Vegas today and decided to stop in Scottsdale for food and gas.  We happened to drive by a nice looking restaurant called Amy's Baking Company so we decided to have a light lunch. We both decided to started out with a Quinoa-Sesame soup and was charged $1.50 each for a few crackers!?  It took over 35 minutes to receive two small bowls of soup, which was barely warm and didn't even taste very good.  Not sure what was going on in the kitchen but wasn't worth the wait!  The server seemed nice but had no control of what came out of the kitchen.  We were very disappointed and hoping for a nice lunch experience but didn't happen. Unfortunately, we won't be coming back."
2014-05-09,a6Qj6kOKSTyzpPkENCHwCg,"So, yes, I am the tourist who admittedly went to ABC because I saw it on Kitchen Nightmares. My family and I stopped in for lunch while vacationing in Scottsdale and all four of us were DELIGHTED with the food and the service. We had the three cheese pizza, the BBQ chicken and mango pizza, a pear salad, and, of course, dessert. Everything we had EXCEEDED our expectations!  The pizzas were great, the salad was fresh and the desserts were perfect. We got the candy bar tort and the chocolate covered cheesecake and ate every last morsel. I will recommend ABC to all of my family in the greater Phoenix area and I will share my experience with people when I get back to Chicago. Thanks Amy and Sammy."
2013-06-08,aKhv49qQ1A1MDvGZ-cVh7Q,"""Are we REALLY doing this?"" That was my thought as I parked my car. A bunch of us were getting together for a friend's going away and it was decided to have it at Amy's Baking Company. I'll preface this by saying that I hadn't heard about Amy's until it made the news after the whole Gordon Ramsay debacle. So after playing catch up and fulling understanding the buzz it was with more than a little trepidation that I walked through the door. I immediately liked the atmosphere and the music they were playing.I was welcomed by our server Debbie and ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger. While my meal was being prepared we were well looked after by the staff who made sure that our water and sodas were full.When my Bleu Ribbon Burger arrived, it was HUGE, cooked up a perfect medium rare topped with bleu cheese and bits of bacon with a home made bun that was heavenly. The bun was actually a little too big but it was so good that I had to make the choice of finishing off the bun or trying to save room for dessert. I opted for Plan BThis is the SAME burger that Gordon Ramsay trashed (which I saw on You Tube). So unless these guys COMPLETELY changed up the preparation of this item I honestly don't know what Mr.Ramsay was flipping out about. It came with a nice side salad and I got a side of fries which were good. I really enoyed it and it was a LOT of food.Their dessert display is VERY impressive and everything looks delicious. While my favorite Key Lime pie of all time is still Chelsea's Kitchen, these guys serve up a good too. I also got to try their mousse which was delicious and their candy bar pie (or cake? Not sure, I think I was slipping into a diabetic coma at this point) was ""eyes roll back in your head"" good.The staff were all very welcoming and gracious and Sammy made sure we were enjoying everything. And they were absolute SAINTS for splitting our bill 14 ways. So this really was an enjoyable night and I think everyone in our group was very pleasantly surprised.  I have to to admit that after reading the reviews and hearing all of the chatter I didn't know what I was in for. But I had a great meal and experience and would not hesitate to come back here again if I were in the area."
2014-06-20,aOXcBMZOuiS4HFA0oMsX1w,It was such an explosive episode of kitchen nightmares I just had to try it for myself. Upon entering the establishment. I was greeted by samy who promptly seated us. Things seemed ok at first  we then placed our order. My friend took out her Camera to take a few photos and then the bomb went off. Samy started yelling and cussing at us followed by Amy running out of the kitchen like a crazy woman. We got up to leave and they threatened us because we had already ordered calling us thieves. They blocked the door to the exit and we had to Physically push Amy out of the way to leave the restaurant. I have NEVER in my life experienced anything like this. They need to be locked up somewhere as they are seriously a threat to themselves and their customers. It's not worth going even for the show. You will regret it.
2010-10-28,abF9Emgog8H5AMDpnMGIig,"Stopped in this little place for a quick bite before a movie on Sunday and had the best Albacore tuna sandwich ever in history. I could not believe how good it was. The tuna had chunks of green apples and sweet toasted pecans. Sandwich was served on cinnamon raisin bread which I normally would not have ordered, but it was perfect. After the movie went back there for wine because it was only $4.00 a glass on Sunday afternoons. What a wonderful afternoon with friends. Although I did not eat pastries, I checked them out in the case and they were beautiful, will definitely go back and buy for little gifts when I visit the Grandmas. Small and perfect desserts.Loved, loved this little place! Prices were fair."
2014-12-28,agLiFRX9zN3dbP2GKg7rQQ,"Had an amazing experience! Delicious food, great service and adorable atmosphere!! I went with 9 people we all had a great time!  Don't believe everything you hear!!"
2014-08-24,al7VJCWzcKgung8NrHWiHA,My mom and I went to the bakery tonight to get dessert. It was really good. They were extremely friendly and the entire place was spotless. I don't think it's fair that they are getting reviews by people that have never gone inside. I will go back!
2012-04-28,arastZzkfUE59y1MPAgVbw,First time at Amy's was AMAZING!!!  The food was delicious and owners are exteremenly friendly and nice.   I can not wait to go back and take the family.  It is a must try and you will not be disappointed.
2014-07-17,b6WRBVDieqwei4wC1rOsnA,"Of course you may have heard of Amys' Baking Company from TV. It did not cast it in a good light, and now that I have visited I can tell you my Experience was anything but dramatic.The owner Samy Greeted us at the door and we asked to be seated as we were excited to try some food from this controversial kitchen. The menu was filled with appetizing pizza combinations, hummus and bread appetizers, but I wasn't thorough because I lasered in on the FIG PROSCIUTTO PIZZA instantly and knew i wanted to try it. He assured us it was a filling meal and that is all I wanted, plus cake.As we waited we walked over to the amazing dessert display in the front and I saw tons of amazing delectable's. Flourless Chocolate Truffle, Creme Brule, Flourless German Chocolate , Truffle Chocolate with MEOW written on it, Key Lime Pie and Candy Bar Tart. There was even a new item Amy had made that day with raisins and that was so intriguing. She really does have a Flour Thumb, its like a green thumb except for baking. It was delicious and from there we ordered 3 kinds of cake to take home with us. Each was easily the best of its category that I have ever tried. The German Chocolate, the Flourless Chocolate sans Peanut, and the Chocolate Truffle were totally worth it. The Flourless German had a perfect brown cream frosting on top with coconut shaving and the coolest gold edible glitter I have ever seen. Which was surprising as I have never seen that before. Turns out Amy makes this herself and that is awesome.The Fig Prosciutto Pizza was soo good. The saltiness of the meat, the fresh home grown figs, the cheeses, and the kalamata olives mixed in this totally unexpected way that just made you want more. I ate all that pizza. There is no sharing when you get one.The restaurant was beautifully decorated with cool black chandeliers and extremely clean. I think its really unfair that these owners have had to deal with so much negativity, because when you eat the food and enjoy your time here its just sad to know that passionate people can become targeted for instances of behavior that don't reflect the quality of the business. Next time I visit Phoenix I won't leave until I have eaten at Amy's. :D"
2014-02-16,bMpQ0ZuAW9lYMUwwq23Ekg,"Overpriced food, horrible food, and the Atmosphere was so tense it was uncomfortable. I honestly can see why the Restaurant is so empty all the time. I tried to go in with an open mind but wasn't able to keep one. I think Chef Ramsey was right about this one No offense."
2014-04-21,bTTGMT0GJRJs518l3ZBNkg,I tried this restaurant during a recent vacation and this is the absolute worst food and restaurant I have ever seen in my entire life. NO wonder Gordon Ramsay gave up on these two! All I know is I have eaten a multiple Gordon Ramsay restaurants...and I have eaten at Amy's Baking Company......no comparison! Do not eat here! You will save yourself the torture of having to endure a crappy meal with crappy service!
2014-01-04,bTzFdoRg33hWEusGfkm6pA,We have revisited three times. Impressed and enjoyed every time. Their chocolate cake is out of this world!
2013-07-01,bU6Gal4FoJzS-0T-t9zCXQ,"So . . . . . yeah . . . . Amy's Baking Company was so awful it made me get off my ass and revive my yelp account.  I was in Scottdale for business recently and I, like . . . . the entire interwebs, was super curious. I wanted to like this place and to think that modern sensationalist TV was screwing them over. Not so. Like . . . .  a LOT not so. I won't bore you with a a lot of details, but I came here with two friends around 8 PM. We were greeted warmly by the Guy owner. We ordered chicken pizza, cheese pizza, and the salmon burger. We wanted to order appetizers, up until the Guy told us that bread wasn't included in the hummus plate. Seriously - for real??The food was average - crappy in all respects. I wouldn't go back. But the worst part was when we ordered dessert, which I hoped would AT LEAST be palatable, it came with protein rich fruit flies!! Yum!! Complaining to the Guy only got us yelled at and told we were stupid yelpers. Or reddits . . . . or something. It was hard to keep track, but suffice it to say, he was VERY unhappy that we would point this LITTLE problem out to them. Honestly, I can't believe that something on reality TV was LEGIT as crappy as it was portrayed. Whaddya know."
2014-04-12,bZfRJ8t8j4mki7m3TIassQ,"I live in mesa, work in scottsdale decided to give this place a try. I don't have cable so I must have missed what happened, hope they have it on YouTube. Unfortunately the food was not so good (and I am not a picky eater! As long as it has cheese it's all good) but the lasagna was tasteless. The dessert was great! Thank you! And that's the reason for the two stars. Waiter was great. Owner not so nice. The vibe was a bit off, felt like they didn't want us there!But I would like to say to my other wonderful YELPERS that calling these people names ...the c*** word etc....lowers us to their same level of insanity.So I will do my part and no longer make them money, simply don't eat there!But please please let's be civil,adult, educated people and not bullies!!!!They are still people...someone wrote that they should be shot?? Why?? Over bad attitude? Lots of people would be lined up and executed including some of you and maybe me....who knows!? All I'm saying is this is getting kinda extreme...Some reviews make me laugh till I cry and smile, but some are just vile and make me deeply sad.Let that marinate......"
2013-11-28,bac-jKB9EGkBhvd9ryngmw,"This is when I wish Yelp offered 1/2 stars.  Yes, I admit it, we came to Phoenix to meet the people who had the epic meltdown on Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmare.  I was pleasantly surprised.Let me set the mood.  The restaurant is located in a shopping mall (not uncommon in Phoenix) with plenty of parking and a movie theatre next door (if people still do dinner and a movie).  The parking lot is very dimly lit, so if you have trouble seeing at night (which I do), take this into consideration.The Resturant is beautiful. As you enter, you are greeted by owner Samy, who is very enthusiastic and very intense.  The restaurant is decorated as classic Italian, with a lovely photo of the couple/owners and a letter from former President George W. Bush that hung over my head.  The desert case is beautiful and filled with the most delicious cakes and pastries (more on that later).We ordered the flat bread, (its huge, so don't fill up or you won't have room for the main course) which was delicious and freshly made.  We weren't offered a dipping sauce, which would have been nice.My kids ordered the pizza, which was tasty, but had a light vinegar taste, which I have to assume was added and not because of bad ingredients.  All of the ingredients were fresh and nothing tasted frozen.  My wife ordered the ziti which was good, but not inspired.  I would have added more garlic and salt.  I ordered the spaghetti aioli with spicy shrimp scampi.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner.  The pasta was lightly oiled with a nice spice and the shrimp well cooked with a good bite.  I know there has been talk that Amy doesn't make her deserts, but we not only saw her cooking them, we could smell it all through the restaurant.  The deserts are must and very, very good.Samy and Amy were very generous with their time, offering us insight into the show and their experiences since.  Although we came for ""train wreck"", we were surprised by the food.  Overall, I would say to give ABC a try and judge for yourself."
2014-12-30,bgztkHn-BiGyfSeAmguxXQ,"Apparently, both of them were in the bad mood. My foods was horrible and I waited over more than an hour, just for my foods. The only good was the deserve. Such a shamed.  This business should be close down . Never to return here again, Even McDonald is better."
2015-05-17,biCxuaqKGm_ZYrR20r8cIw,"I was looking for a birthday cake, or considering Sprinkles, but saw Amy's on my Yelp search for bakeries and thought I'd give it a try.   Oh my, my, my!   Rather than purchase an entire cake, which was more than needed, Amy kindly suggested that I try a sampling of desserts, and what a perfect solution it was.   I ordered two of the gorgeous heart shaped flourless chocolate cake, a slice of super moist pineapple cake, a small lemon meringue pie,  a few tiny key lime tarts, and a slice of carrot cake.   And how much fun did we have digging in and sampling each of these spectacular delights?  Lots of fun, that's how much!   That was hands down the best dessert sampler I have ever had, and my guests agreed.   Everyone had to find out where to find Amy's!   The service was super good.  Samy was friendly and helpful, and although evidently quite busy, Amy made sure I was happy and came to check on my selection, which was very thoughtful of her.  My only confusion is why that place wasn't busier.  There was one table seated, and the patrons were raving about how delicious their food was.  I see other similar reviews, so why isn't that place busting at the seams?   Give them a shot, it will be worth your while, I promise.   When you go, I hope you try the pineapple cake if it's available.  It was one of the most interesting and delicious desserts I've ever experienced, so tender and moist, such complex flavors, and not super sweet, just right!  Go Amy, you are a star!"
2014-03-03,bj_noHlJDBTUlsRGcP5tig,I ate here while visiting family during vacation. I had no idea this was on TV until I came to write this review. These people are rude and crazy. The restaurant is super slow and the food is horrible. I wish that I would have seen kitchen nightmares ahead of time. These people are terrible and I hope they close.
2013-06-03,bkNzdY8rWMob0u449L_F3g,"ABC was advertising a ""special event"" celebration with a four-course closed menu meal on May 31, 2013. We were anxious to give them an unbiased, ""fair shot"" review, and were planning a special trip to PHX around this event (we go frequently, but penciled a trip when we found this event).Glad to say we just ""penciled"" the trip, because we tried for four days via ABC's online reservations systems, telephone, and social media to confirm the event and a reservation. Despite numerous attempts using both our names, we were never able to get a response.Mind you, this was an advertised event.  I find it deplorable and inexcusable that a service-based establishment would advertise an event and then completely and utterly fail to respond or provided support to that event.Unfortunately, this review was meant to be an unbiased and truthful relation of our experience at the oft-malingered bistro, but that didn't happen. Instead, the review is being written to show our actual experience with what seems to be nothing more than contempt for customers. They advertised an event, and then completely and utterly failed to respond to any inquiries about the event by any means listed.  That is, in our opinion, wholly inexcusable.You want to stop responding to potential customers in all ways? That's your prerogative. But advertising a special event and then ignoring respondents is terrible practice. I would love to have given a fair and unbiased review of the food, but our horrible experience trying to get a response killed it.We're done trying to give this place a chance. We can't speak to the food, but this is a real review of a real (and disappointing) experience, and I have the message logs, phone records, etc. to prove it. Truly disappointed."
2013-11-07,cOgZU976DIQ0nxgHLf3p3w,"After seeing the Ramsay show, I felt I had to come and meet Samy and Amy. I must say that I had a great time there! Samy welcomed me so lovely, he made me an eslresso which was one of the best I had in a while, and I am very sophisticated about my coffee. Samy made sure to bring  ice cold water a side which is the thing to do. They were so nice, we took a picture together and they didn't want to take money... I will definitelly come back to visit and eat, this time I was just not far away from lunch. Leave the reality shows alone and go have some good time with them - they are truly a humble hard working couple"
2013-12-20,cRYQ3oQYIKBZ2cKCDVS0lg,I had a 1 star review on here depicting my awful experience and it was removed which is funny to me
2013-08-21,cRyZaZNuuoq_1lBTNRmQDA,"We've all seen Kitchen Nightmares. We've seen the meltdowns, the arguments, Gordon leaving. I've seen reviews here that say none of it is true, and some that say it is 100% accurate. I'm leaning towards the latter after my visit.Firstly, the food took absolutely forever to come out. And by forever, I mean it never came. After about an hour and a half of waiting for a PIZZA (one pizza, at that), we left, as well as got into a bit of an argument with the restaurants owner. Point is, please don't come to this place. Let it fade away into nothingness."
2016-02-22,cflCDIvywPyqqvw4rOBXAg,Glad its closed its truly some people that never should be in food services.. I ate here nov of last year gave them a honest review (food service horrid) the meal was horrible of course they deleted it but karma came back around...thanks Ms Karma
2013-05-24,cg3k9MfPXMVOwBOXcAbzEw,"I stopped in last week, on the night of the re opening. It didn't work. I did something I had never done-left without dessert, which looked tempting. However, I wasn't ooh to let these fools of ""business owners"" and a ""chef"" take my money. They should have let Gordon Ramsay say, and be open to change. All I need to tell all of you readers is to not even boter with them at Amy's B.C.. How can I trust people that have run in with the law so many times! The food sucks-dreadful-my pizza was undercooked, and then she burned it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.... BOO."
2013-05-22,chqhZ5cOywnGFxaUG1w4ZQ,"I have to admit I came to this place with my parents out of curiosity.  We were the first people there.  A few others came in later, but while some people may think I work there, I don't.  Samy greeted us and we chose our seats.  Without the bright camera lights, the décor was nice.  My mother is a vegetarian and she ordered eggplant parmesan.  I ordered the infamous Blue ribbon burger.  My dad ordered a different burger (I forgot which kind).  Samy kept apologizing for the show and I felt bad for him.  The food came out just as a few other people arrived.  There was no wait staff I saw other than Samy.  I had originally posted funny quips but I'm changing this review to reflect a more accurate account of what happened.  The food was great.  It was really darn good.  My parents are tough critics and my mother is picky since she's a vegetarian.  We enjoyed it.  Amy came out to the counter to look to see if everything was okay and each of us told her the food was great.  She looked very tired and thin.  The stress of everything has gotten to her and despite everything I felt bad for her too.  She seemed please and went back to the kitchen.  We had sweet potato fries and coconut cream pie for desert which were also great. So this isn't a four page review, but taking aside all the hoopla and drama, this was a nice restaurant and since this original date, I've been there again."
2014-03-14,cpbShCag1jcwVSpnhECmig,"We were visiting from Chicago and my cousin Gary, who lives in Scottsdale, said ""you have to eat at Amy's"" but didn't say why until we left.    My wife and I weren't aware of the Kitchen Nightmare's debacle until he told us later.I've got to say this was one of the worst eating experiences.  Crappy doughy pizza and burgers at outrageous prices.  I'm somewhat used to rudeness in some delis and bars in the city, but this was over the top  and terribly mean-spirited.  Note to the owners:  shut up!   Note to waitstaff:  we love you!My cousin told us the owners are saying  bloggers are in a conspiracy to defame Amy's.   In the case of this ""restaurant"", defamation isn't necessary, nor is a conspiracy.  A a fact-based evaluation is all it takes.And a final note, this to blogger  Maddie L.:  excellent idea for a negative star system!   Could be from -1 to -5 stars, but for Amy's Yelp might want to go deeper into the negatives."
2016-07-23,cyYQqWEhGJ6Mrvyry5Vn3w,First walked in and was surprised at how nice the decor was! I ordered a pizza along with a cake that only cost $80 . I only had to wait for 50 minutes! I don't blame sam and amy for taking the tips; the waitresses make $9 and hour!
2013-08-02,d7o08M7OMPeXE5SpuFF6cw,sammy and amy are Racists first of all let me say i am a proud gay man  we went in there with a group of us guys and a few ladies and sammy figured out we were gay and was giving us dirty looks and after 40 min waiting on food we asked to speak do the owner and when he came over he got upset and asked us to leave and pay for our water and bread as we were getting up he said fucking fags you should all be killed we were so upset and now are considering a lawsuit for slander and a hate crime
2014-07-19,dMM7IVu6cwkMJ7S7jzUHxw,"The food at Amy's Baking Company was delicious.  Of course, my husband and I went because of the notoriety from the show, Kitchen Nightmares.  I must say, I was impressed, and will be back the next time I am in Scottsdale.My husband had the Three Cheese Pizza.  The crust was fabulous.  Nice crunch on the bottom, with a fluffy, savory center.  The flavors of the cheese, along with the beaten egg were perfect.I had the Homemade Lasagna with Bolognese and Pepperoni.  The lasagna came out hot and was obviously freshly prepared.  The Bolognese Meat Sauce was robust and flavorful.  The cheese to noodle to sauce ratio were perfect.The portions of food were huge, and aptly fit the price.  My husband and I both only ate half of our meals, so we would be able to save room for one of Amy's delectable desserts.  We chose a Creme Brulee and Chocolate Cake.  This dessert was the perfect ending to our meal.  It was rich in flavor and the combination of chocolate and Creme Brulee will definitely make my mouth water at every thought.  Our service was that of a 5 star restaurant.  Both, Samy and the waitress (I didn't catch her name) were attentive and a pleasure to speak with.  We had a wonderful experience, and will defintely be back."
2015-04-02,dSWJYuyqJXL6Bw8roBsUJw,"In honesty, I probably would have given Amy's four stars (I don't just hand out five willy-nilly), but I feel like I should offset the bad reviews given by people who've never actually eaten here.That said, I also must admit that I came with my friend because we loved the Kitchen Nightmare episode, but during our two hours there were nothing like what I saw on TV. Although I only saw Amy in passing, Sammy was super kind and gracious. I actually felt bad because he looked so stressed out when we walked in, yet the moment he noticed us he put on his game face and acted exactly like a wonderful host would. He went above and beyond to make sure that my buddy and I were having a great experience. Empathy aside, the most important aspect of any restaurant experience is obviously the food-and man oh man was it good! We split the hummus, which is served with flat bread and all I can say is DE-LISH. The bread came out warm and soft and well seasoned. And as odd as this sounds, I was impressed that the bread didn't get stale in 20 minutes like most flat breads do. And the hummus was definitely fresh.Amy even sprinkles whole garbanzo beans on the top. I'm disappointed that I didn't get to try the cheese and prosciutto panini (because seriously you guys, prosciutto is the bomb), but my buddy was getting full and we had to order dessert, obvi. Again, no disappointments there! The desserts were beautiful, but more importantly they tasted excellent. My only complaint is that the desserts are pretty pricey (I have to add that Sammy was sure to let me know how much they cost, so I in no way felt cheated). I'm sure the price reflects the precision and labor that goes into making them so aesthetic (my friend's had glitter on it), but I guess the way I see it, fancy looking desserts are like nice lingerie-there's really no point because you're not going to look at it for more than five seconds anyway.In conclusion, it's time to lift the ban on Amy's."
2014-04-12,dvYuSxL57SMKrcei8k5ysQ,"Went here w/family last year (b4 ""Nightmares""). Food was intolerable. Dessert was decent enough. Didn't leave tip, because family members informed me about owners taking the tips.  So, to clarify to person from Santa Clara (me=born & raised in CA),in CA IT IS ILLEGAL TO TAKE STAFF TIPS-BUT NOT IN AZ (of course). The hourly wage in a lot of ""red"" states is very low. Barely above Federal minimum. Unlike CA."
2013-06-10,dyr5xiAdJbheYx98-LLPnA,I normally don't take time out of my busy life to write reviews etc so I'm gonna make this short and to the point. I'm born and raised in Scottsdale and  my experience was nothing less than unsatisfactory. Horrible food and a waste of money and time. Just another place that starts and fails in a matter of a couple years. My friends and I will stick with our tried and true local eateries that make our Old Town Scottsdale home.
2013-10-31,edoLBernyxNKavMvkv5aXw,"I have been to Amy's a few times over the last few months and I have to disagree with some of the reviews on here. I'll sum up my experiences upon meeting Amy, Samy and their food. First off, Amy and Samy couldn't have been nicer. Each time I went in for food, I was blown away. Yes, I was curious about meeting them after watching the show, but the truth is that they couldn't have been nicer. The food is as good as it looks. The restaurant itself is immaculate. I've seen Amy herself cleaning up, mopping the floor. you could eat off this floor.  I have tried the infamous Blue Ribbon Burger,  Asparagus Pizza and their desserts (AMAZING!!!) Amy's Key Lime Pie is delicious. Tastes like no other!!! Just to show you I'm not completely biased, I had the hummus and it was good, not crazy about it, but it was good, but her presentation of all of her food looks Great!!! Does the food take long, a little, but do you want food that looks and tastes like crap or food that looks and tastes great. ABC reminds me of why we go out to eat in the first place, Great food and good times to spend with family and friends. First time in awhile that I wasn't asking to use their WiFi:) Overall great experience and definitely a supporter for as long as you'll have us."
2014-12-16,elyFxS3PzzcXWq55jgxuLw,They were okay. I had the eggplant parm which was a bit too breaded. My husband had the chicken parm with same compliant. Service was fine and nothing like you see on TV. The husband came by and asked if everything was okay and acted pretty normal.
2013-09-22,et6wpO-7qqABowQFNyQjXw,"Amazing dessert!!!! WOW!  So of course we saw the show and wanted to come in and give it a try.  We came in for dessert on a Friday night and the place was virtually empty.  We had great service and were promptly provided ice waters.  We were able to look at the gorgeous dessert case and we picked two flourless items::  German Chocolate torte and a white chocolate/chocolate mousse.  OMG these were the BEST gluten free desserts I have ever had, and that same thought was echoed around the table.  The German Chocolate was a such a treat, the coconut was delish!  The mousse was so rich and decadent!  We were not able to finish these two desserts and they gladly boxed them up so we could eat the rest the next day.  Everyone else in the group got a coffee or drink made by Sammy and they were very pleased.  We are still talking about those desserts two days later and can't wait to go back and try more!!!  Thank you Amy for those amazing gluten free desserts!"
2014-07-22,f-SF6xgqYC43oMjXI5DHbQ,"I went here as a tourist expecting to get the whole kitchen nightmare experience and I can't say one bad thing about the place.  The food was a little overpriced but everything we had was good.  Veggie pizza,  spinach pesto gnocchi, and oir daughter had a simple penne with tomato sauce. We took two desserts to go. Everyone was incredibly friendly. (I did advise my husband not to leave a tip knowing that the servers dont see a penny of it but  he left a tip anyway becase the husband was in front serving us as well.)  I wouldnt come out of my way to eat here again bit it was definitely not the nightmare I was anticipating."
2014-05-24,f1Wx54tZBB8VKcYzuTbVqw,This place has the best pizza at a great price. The medium is large enough to feed two adults. The pizza was cooked perfectly and the service was fast and friendly. The place was very clean. There's also a full bar stocked with high quality liquor.  I live 30 min away but I can tell you the pizza alone was worth the trip but I want to try the other items. I tried the white chocolate coconut cream tart for dessert and it was also great. I'm not sure how you go to this restaurant and write a bad review.
2014-04-20,f7nzsAP2J1c-r3Jzt6py9w,"Wonderful food here, and a really calm atmosphere. Take everything with a grain of salt when it comes to realty t.v. Because all these people truly are, are hardworking small business owners, and Amy is a chef. WONDERFUL food here."
2014-04-17,fJV9bi9OI09AWSPkQMa2VA,I was in town from Chicago and my wife and myself went to check the place out..After hearing all the negative stories we judged for ourselves.Did not have a meal but did try the deserts and they were very good. Maybe Amy has her niche being a pastry chef because we would go back just to keep sampling the creations Amy designs..Sami was a very accomidating host..not the beast he is made to be...Give it a try with an open mind..
2014-01-21,fN4p_6jFo-aBCFcSRzuCUQ,"This was my third time to visit ABC in 6 months. I have received outstanding, quality food and service each visit to the restaurant. For all the haters: don't knock something until you try it for yourself and learn more about the reality of the situation. My friends and I ordered the Red Pepper Hummus with Pita bread for an appetizer - like we do each time we visit. It was amazing as usual! We then ordered the Garlic Chicken Pizza (without the mushrooms). The pizza was cooked to perfection, and my tastebuds were delighted. And what is a visit to Amy's without getting one of her homemade desserts!? We got a Creme Brulee and savored each bite we took. I would recommend ABC to anyone looking for a nice restaurant to eat at with great food for an amazing price and great quality service! And if you're in the area late (after dinner) and are craving something sweet, do stop in and enjoy one of Amy's desserts. You won't be disappointed!"
2012-10-26,fUowaPuKIqCS6pQQnMZsIw,"Owner was very rude.  He really did not care how his customers felt.  We ordered soup and pasta, both where very salty. The soup was so salty that we could not eat it.   When we told the owner, he tasted it and then said it was not salty! Not only he didn't apologize but insisted that it was fine!!! Very odd place. We're never going back."
2015-04-21,fVlxtrbO8twkrgl5qNpakQ,Best lunch in the valley for us Seattle spring visitors. We will be back!  Such friendly owners who desire to make your meal the best... Are here 1 year ago with old menu and had great food then.  This new menu is yummy
2014-04-27,fbKkByJ2-pqwuQW3uobG_g,"Food awful, help awful, owners rude and arrogant. Worst place ever! Avoid like the plague. The stuff that came out my other end smelled better.They are so full of themselves that they have a t-shirt that says ""Here's your pizza, go fcuk yourself."" And they want your business? What's up with that?"
2014-12-22,fcXr7rGkoe_PFTdFNTB0FQ,Drove all the way here from Phoenix with two of my coworkers...I honestly LOVE this place! Sammy was super friendly and helpful and immediately offered us drinks. I got the ham and cheese Panini and it came with a salad. Both the salad and the Panini were delicious! I would recommend this place to ANYONE! It's a wonderful restaurant with great service and awesome food! Amy and Sammy were laughing and joking with us by the end of the night. I will definitely be coming back here!
2014-05-22,fccAAN1aO9tEEcOYH6P63Q,"Amy's Baking Company has gotten a lot of heat lately. I was not a fan at how she acted on the show. Then watching the second show, i saw how heavily edited the first show was. So I decided to go in myself and find out. So a couple of my peers that attend Arizona Culinary School together and I went to Amy's to try it out. We were gracefully greeted. Samy was so helpful. I then asked to also meet Amy. She was busy in the back but caught a quick break to say Hi to us. We ordered our drinks and food. It was nice to see that there were 4 other families who frequented ABC before, several times and were remembered by name. Very pleasant. I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Ravioli Rustica. It was amazing! OMGosh I loved it. My best friend Ciara ordered the Caesar Salad, which she loved and my friend Nicole ordered the Chicken Fett Alfredo which i loved as well. Very well seasoned all the dished were. My friend Ciara decided to order the Rustica, my dish, to take home to her BF for dinner. We were then asked if we'd like a tour of her kitchen, bc we were in our Chef's Uniform, and we would appreciate the tour. It was amazing, and immaculate. MEaning, it wasnt made up just for the show. What made my even happier was hearing that she did take her Kosher and vegetarian and any other guest very seriously. One of her cooks thought it'd be fun to throw bacon into one of he friers to have some fun and make her own creation and Amy lit her up bc that oil was now tainted by a pork/ meat product. So she made the girl empty and clean it out. Mind you, had that been my establishment, I would have charged the girl for the oil that was destroyed. I loved Amy's and have now changed the mind of all my Chefs to try it out for themselves instead of being the Chef's they teach us not to be."
2014-01-07,fecvjHGcZuDQud3SYUphFA,"Stopped in for a bite just before going to see ""Saving Mr. Banks"" with my friend Kristi.   I ordered garlic flat bread and my friend ordered a side salad and we each had a glass of house wine.  What arrived was a medium sized pizza shaped dough that didn't look appetizing.  It was a dry, warm bread sprinkled with garlic powder.  Has the cook ever heard of fresh garlic or olive oil?  I asked the waiter for a dipping sauce because the bread was so plain and he told me there would be an additional $5 price.  Really?  Are you kidding me? The menu prices were inconsistent with the quality of food served.  My friend's side salad came with a dressing that  was just gross.  No other word comes to mind to describe it.  I wish I had the nerve to send it all back.  The bill shows up for $30. Waste of money!!!   Of course, no intention of ever going back.  I don't see this restaurant staying open for the long haul.  It's restaurants like this that make sticking to my diet easy."
2014-07-12,fgNVnOQHOX4IcvCQ3d3Bgw,"Seriously Yelp? What is the deal here. The situation surrounding this restaurant has me doubting the validity of Yelp and all restaurant rating sites alike. I saw the reviews and watched the Gordon Ramsey show (and the follow up) so I was curious to see what Amy's is really like. I don't live in the area, but have been on vacation in Phoenix, so I made the trip out to Scottsdale mostly for the novelty and was expecting the worst. The place was completely empty, though we did arrive at 1:30 on a Saturday. Nice indoor seating as well as a patio, immaculately clean everywhere. There are probably 12 small tables inside and a giant display of bakery goods. We were seated at the window by the only waitress working. She was friendly. Sammy and Amy were both there. Sammy checked on us several times and was pleasant. Asked us about our visit, etc. We ordered the jalapeño artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was huge, probably enough for four people but we ate the whole thing. The dip was refreshing and spicy. Really want the recipe because it would make great tailgating food. The bread was some of the best I have ever tasted. Very soft and flavorful; smelled good too.The pizza we ordered had prosciutto, pear, figs, caramelized onions, and goat cheese on it. My boyfriend and I both agreed it was  probably the best pizza we have ever had. We are not mere pizza charlatans; we have eaten pizza from famous pizzerias far and wide, including the allegedly fabulous Pizzeria Bianco just a few miles away (Which sucks, by the way). The prosciutto was melt in your mouth delicious and there were just a TON of toppings on it. Whole figs! Delicious goat cheese! The crust is made of the same bread as the appetizer comes with. It's softer than most pizzas but was perfect for the toppings we chose. We only ate three pieces between the two of us because it is a huge serving.We paid (~$25 for app and pizza with waters) and then looked at the bakery display. We were too full to get anything but they looked beautiful. Amy came out and chatted with us for a bit and was very sweet and thanked us for complimenting her food and for eating there.Would come back in a heartbeat if I lived here. Loved the food and that is what is most important. What everyone needs to keep in mind is that television crews can make anyone look crazy if they want to. To be fair, many reviewers have actually bullied these people who are simply working hard to make a living. Dine here with an open mind and then pass your own judgment. I sure am glad I gave it a chance."
2014-04-20,fvT4LOkOqnpYpehJnbBPGg,"Don't believe the stories. Go and try it yourself. Wife and I went there for lunch with another friend and were very happy with everything. The place was clean, the salads we ordered were great, the drinks were good and the flourless chocolate cake was absolutely amazing. Sammy  kept making sure we were happy and was very open telling us about their side of the Kitchen Nightmare story. We will def go again."
2013-05-22,fzloiRjnlAZX4Qo1u_X-Iw,"I, too, ate there.  I've eaten at many restaurants in Scottsdale.  I wanted to try this one out, especially with all the hype.  I was not disappointed.I decided to order the same pizza that Ramsey did on the show, and it was far, far too sweet.  I do not know how this pizza was a great success, as was claimed.  It was not.  It fell far, far flat.  The drinks were expensive, and sure, that may be due to the fact that this restaurant is on Shea Boulevard.  Regardless, this could have been better.I did not see Samy swearing, but he was clearly getting angry at different staff members.  Save your money, do not come here."
2013-10-09,gPHnKdf8kAqBcezh6-4MCQ,"The only positive thing I can say about this place is the interior decor. That being said, it's basically the old saying, ""Would you rather eat a turd sandwich in the dining room, or just eat straight from the outhouse hole? Either way, it's still crap."""
2013-10-20,gpX6eMCnmLhRG0QAc_nzMQ,"I had a chance to stop by Amy's Baking Company on the way to Flagstaff.  Wow, the place was really bad.  The pizza was under cooked and the owners where rude, big time rude.  How can the owner expect to keep the tips from the waitresses? It amazes me.  The burger was dripping with grease and I didn't even finish it.    If you want to go there then good luck.   Of all  the places that I have ever eaten at, this is the worst.I'm not sure if the burger was worst than the pizza.  I was afraid to even try the deserts because of the reviews that I read.  To be fair, they did look good.Anyways, if you have to go there and try it for yourself, be prepared to wait a really long time for pizza and food.  Best Advice: Don't forget to eat first before you go there.  You really don't want to be stuck in that place and hungry."
2014-04-20,h-JKvbTJh24vK80EoYOe4A,"Never ate here but I don't believe anyone should. These people are unfit for human contact as it appears. I'd rather them not be ""homeless,"" as indicated by previous yelpers, but honestly find jobs where they're less vulnerable to human contact and criticism. Also, go to Church..and not the one Amy's going to now because its apparent that her morals and beliefs are all construed within her brain. I'm honestly going to be praying that these folks open their eyes and turn over a new leaf for the sake of their lives, relationship..and their cats. Seriously, can we just start a ""Just Don't Do it!"" campaign..and seriously stop funding their insanity?"
2013-09-26,hJA0mlQViZQ44kz716S_iw,"I saw a movie today, and the theater was right next to Amy's Baking Company, so I walked near the front door after I got out, and that Armenian dude yelled at me and told me I was on camera. I was almost gonna ask them about their job offer too."
2015-07-26,hSNC_0y97CxCXDM6H5R-xQ,"don't judge by what you see in TV or the media, just go there and you will see something different!, I went there yesterday and I really liked it, they are kind and the sweet there is so delicious."
2015-07-24,hW8Cc_puBDna-1IQWS6UPA,"I was in town for a wedding. I was staying at a friends nearby and decided to come in for a quick bite before the wedding rehearsal mainly because the outside looked inviting. When I walked in the place looked very warm and comforting. Little did I know that was all that was so welcoming to customers.i ordered a pizza that took 40 minutes to come out. By that time I thought I was hungry enough to eat anything...until I took a bite. the bottom of the crust was crunchy but the inside was doughy and undercooked. When I sent it back, the owner(?) came out and asked what was wrong. He looked pretty amped up and not wanting a confrontation on my vacation I said that my stomach wasnt feeling well and thought that a dessert would feel better. To be fair, the lemon cake was kind of tasty though a bit dry. About the time I finished, that same guy I talked with was raising his voice at another customer when she was paying her bill. I felt that was my cue to leave.I cannot, in good faith, give this place more than one star nor can I recommend this place to anybody."
2014-05-18,hdVt9uLxWKgFOt4rl5v8gA,"I was in Arizona last week visiting my daughter. We were in the area after a doctors appointment and stopped in for dessert. The restaurant was clean, bright and elegant. We were greeted by Sammy who was very nice and helpful. He answered all of my questions and explained what each dessert was while I made up my mind what to choose. They all looked sooo good! Wish I could have tasted everyone! My daughter and I, shared a piece of Chocolate covered cheesecake and a Coconut cream tart...both of which were excellent. Brought a slice of the Chocolate peanut butter cake for my husband to taste, as well. Sammy, was kind enough to ask me if I wanted it packed on ice as I was about an hour away from my daughter house in Peoria, and the temperature outside was over 100 degrees. I thanked him for the thoughtful offer and asked him if I could take a photo with him instead. He said, it was his honor. We'll go back again, next time I am in Arizona visiting my children. We saw Amy for a brief moment as she was busy in the back baking but Sammy did introduce her to us after I told him to please tell his wife how much we were enjoying her homemade baked goods. Best of luck to both of you!!! Mary from Anthem., NV."
2013-06-19,hoKZAxMOj9XCs0V4k1nIug,"I really wanted to like this place.It's clean and the wait staff are pleasant, but the food is disgusting and undercooked.Prison food would be be a step up.Save your money and go elsewhere."
2014-05-25,hzPmDKyNoilxhrX-AzJK0A,"I've watched the show with my girls and we wanted to see for ourselves.  The food was amazing and everyone else eating in there was saying the same things.  Sammy was SUPER nice!  Amy was busy in the kitchen but took time to come out and say hi... she was SUPER nice too!  Everyone has a bad day here or there or deals with customers that are jerks which is what I think happened on the show... the place is cute, the food is great, the owners are nice people... ignore Ramsey!  Try this place out!  It's great!"
2015-03-06,i41y3zOuSWuH9qlPBPorCQ,"Of course this restaurant was a must visit after their Kitchen Nightmares implosion and upon arriving tried to keep an open mind. All in all our experience was quite lacking. The restaurant was cold and unfriendly, everyone on staff seemed to be on edge, but we ordered French onion soup and hummus to start. Though the food came in a timely manner, the hummus was watery and both were lacking in seasoning. We ordered a specialty pizza which was undercooked and a burger that was not cooked to order and was bland. The only saving grace- delicious desserts. If you must go for a show or out of crazy catlady curiosity, just do the dessert takeout and save the money- rest assured, you can make your own dinner better at home."
2013-08-11,i4sU0cGhPAjir-ApWZACIg,"I was in town last weekend for a family friend's 40th wedding anniversary. My fiance and I decided to stop in after watching the fiasco on Kitchen Nightmares.All I can say is it is a total nightmare, and the experience was uncomfortable. Perhaps it was an off day?I doubt it. We had such high hopes and thought that Ramsay wasn't kind to her and most was done for the sake of television.However ...We both ordered house salads. They both were drowning in the vinaigrette we specifically ordered on the side, and my fiance's came with onions on romaine, which is in fact another menu item, but not what she ordered and she is not a fan of uncooked onions (I like them, but it's not her taste). We informed our server after I ate two bites of mine, and she said she would bring us new salads. They didn't come in the next 20 minutes, when we finally received our food ...The Three Cheese with tomato sauce pizza was about as greasy as it gets, and was/looked burned on the bottom. It had very little sauce to the point where it was dry and the goat cheese had the texture of bleu cheese, hard and crumbly. At this point we heard a lot of LOUD ARGUING going on in the kitchen, and Sammy staring at us and the other patrons from the kitchen door. We asked for a new salad for my fiance. At this point Sammy came to the table and said, ""What's the problem?"" We wanted a box to go, and he said, ""Seriously? This is fresh food meant to be eaten now! I'm not giving you a box."" When we asked to have the salads removed from the check he said, ""No f*$&ing way. You already ate a few bites."" When I said my fiance did not touch hers, he said, ""She probably has an eating disorder. Look how thin she is."" Then he said, ""You have no idea what you're talking about. Get the f&%*out and never come back!""I wish I had a do over and could punch his lights out. We got a real taste of Amy's -- the way Ramsay portrayed it."
2015-07-03,iIagGran-cKhOd-qO63_YQ,I am going 5 stars because we had such a relaxing time and the food was so good and the flat bread and tepanade was awesome.  The food was delicious would totally go back.
2014-06-21,iKQEw2N91X0TOLMMkAV1lg,"I've lost faith in this website so I'm going to be brief.  There's apparently a campaign in place to give this horrible restaurant positive reviews despite all evidence to the contrary.   Even if they have improved, the number of 5-star fanboy (not 3 or 4 but 5) experiences cannot possibly be legitimate based on what I personally saw.I was in Arizona last week and stopped in to gawk at the clown show.  Like I said, I'll be brief.  Bad food and toxic, nasty attitude."
2017-01-04,iLV6zb6jF_xI1hV5NX4qfg,"I'm an honest reviewer, ate there before they closed.The spiciest thing in there was my butthole after I tried their pizza. The owner came knocking at the door of the restroom after I ""was in there too long"" and ""excreting everywhere."" Never going back, toilet paper was unscented, single ply, and store brand. Oh please, rather wipe my anus on sandpaper. AVOID."
2010-11-16,iQEb2vPjGLZH4Yk687mIHA,"Excellent food and pastries.  Wine is inexpensive.  Salads are very memorable.  Chef and husband run the place and it is usually easy to get in.  Opposite the Shea Theatre.  Try it with a movie.  Highly recommend. Lasagna is light and flavorful, carmelized pear salad is sweet and crunchy, and the pizza among the best, with great crust and unusual combinations like fig and prociutto."
2014-06-14,igMX5y9Eb5GJdToCcxPWeQ,"DON'T BELIEVE THE TELEVISION. We are from the Dallas, TX area and were driving on vacation to the Grand Canyon and are HUGE Gordon Ramsey fans. We watch all of his shows. (Kitchen Nightmares, MasterChef, Hell's Kitchen, Hotel Hell, etc...) and wanted to see for ourselves this place from his show. Wow, what a disparity between what was shown on the show and real life. Sammy and Amy are really nice people. They knew we were there because of the show and it didn't matter to them. They took the time to take pictures with my wife, son and I. They even asked the server to take several pictures with our camera and iPhones. The food was dynamite. I had the fig, pear pizza. My wife had the basil pesto gnocchi, and my son had the tomato basil penne. The pizza was out of this world delicious. What a combination of flavors. The sweetness of the fig, with the perscuitto was devine with the just proper enough caramelized onions. My wife said her gnocchi was superb. My son couldn't finish his so we took it with us. The service was exemplary. Very attentive was Sammy as the server as well as another young lady who was excellent as well. Now for the desserts. Holy moly were they soooooo delicious. I had the caramel, chocolate nut tart and my wife and son split a candy bar tart with Oreo crust. Wow, wow, wow, wow were they so delicious. I couldn't finish mine and neither could my wife and son. We had to take all the left overs with us. Now for the real amazing part. Upon learning that it is my birthday, Sammy got me a hat and my wife and son a t-shirt for free. He even put a candle in my dessert and sang Happy Birthday to me. What an amazing experience and so not what you saw on the television on the show. I was so pleasantly surprised. To anyone who has never eaten here, please don't leave negative comments. It would really ruin such a great restaurant and such good food. My wife and I are actually talking about going back on our trip home. If you have the ability, don't miss this chance to taste some amazing food and some flavor pairings that are nothing short of spectacular. Bravo!!"
2015-07-23,innydvRgAJ7IJde_Dj6akA,"As soon as I saw the kitchen nightmares episode, I wanted to visit ABC ASAP! All in all, this place was fine, not the best food but it wasn't as bad as the show portrayed it. I met samy and said hello to him and asked him if I could buy one of his gangster shirts and sadly he said no! There food was fine and pastries were good! I just wish things could have been a bit crazier, maybe a yelling match between samy and a customer! But sadly not."
2013-05-24,inqOxDbn2JgSZe7UhOWU8w,"We decided to return tonight to see how they faired on a Friday night.  We arrived pretty early so there were only 6 tables with a few people.  Things must have settled down because the atmosphere was very pleasant.   I started with the crisp romaine salad a nice mixture of  red onion & sweet tomatoes with the creamy lemon dill dressing.  Very nice...I was surprised by the lemon dill dressing.My wife ordered the Insalata Capresse,  baby organic spinach leaves tossed with homemade preserved lemons, kalamata olives, sweet tomatoes, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella cheese, drizzled with basil pesto & dusted with sea salts. I can't believe how wonderfully Amy merged these flavors to create an unbelievable salad.  As strange as this seems I would actually come back just for this Salad.I ordered the puttanesca gnocchi.  Amy prepares it in a robust tomato sauce with capers, garlic, anchovies black olives and parm cheese.  I think she used pureed kalamata olives as the base in the sauce which gave it a slightly salty taste.  I think I prefer it this way over usually sauted black olives.  Once again, Amy really made this dish shine. I know people will think I am crazy but this sauce can stand up against Scalini Fedeli in NYC any day.  I love Scalini and never thought I would find a puttanesca in AZ that could compare.My wife ordered the asparagus pizza.  Yes I know, sometimes if the chef doesn't know what they are doing the asparagus doesn't come out right.  Not to worry, Amy does it right, all the while making sure the crust stayed nice and crisp.  She combines basil pesto, fresh goat cheese, basil, prosciutto, asparagus & mozzarella to make a nice pie.Hopefully ABC will be open for brunch on Sunday.  I really want to try the Smoked Salmon Poached Eggs.  The picture looks so delicious"
2013-06-29,ir2LinsRSZKHlGTl0i63wg,By far the most disgusting foodI have ever tasted in my life I couldn't even look at it. Not only that but management was horrible and extremely rude. Absolutely a shame to the culinary world. May god be with them
2014-01-30,jDl-B8C2ZMCyoT12RgXg4Q,"Let's be honest, with out Kitchen Nightmares I would have no idea ABC existed.  I had called ahead of time to book a table, Samy said to just stop in and would take care of us. A couple hours later we had shown up, and he knew it was me who called... Very personal! We had a table for 4. It was very quite, the music was at a good volume. I had the Chicken Alfredo and flat bread. It was excellent. 5 plates of food for around $70, I thought it was a good price! Go try it out!"
2012-06-13,jGGQBoFA7P0A8jEcQRhCjA,I really liked it. I thought the key lime pie was divine and I loved the crust! We had pizza and a few drinks and we will go back when we see a movie at Shea 14.
2017-11-12,jSx9cDLKE7uM0_yh8F1fqg,"Flew to Arizona a few months ago to try this. Disappointed that this place closed after Gordon Ramsay's return. Their food was one of the best food I had in my whole entire life!! Their caesar salad was great, sauce is very good. Their pizza was THE BEST I HAD IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. From the garlic crust to the extremely cheesy topping, the pizza was absolutely outstanding. Wish I could come back but its now closed."
2014-05-01,joiVblL-ut1uLo-TQb9b-g,I complained that my pizza was undercooked then a mental midget with a very bad case of Napoleon syndrome decided to yell at my partner and I and THREATENED to kill me.

2013-09-02,jsOA7OPph-NsRjlAjJlo0g,"Stopped by the other day to only be treated with rude customer service and bad food. Uh yeah, nothing has changed one bit."

2013-04-20,jtqsmU1IlFLwESgYZXAOrQ,"Ok after seeing this place on Check Please AZ we decided to try it with friends from Chicago. With a little trepidation after reading all these reviews. Samy the owner couldn't have been nicer. After dinner the chef, Amy, came out to inquire how we liked the dinners. I had the Fig Pear Prosciutto pizza which I thought was a touch too sweet, but my wife and friends loved it. That shows that taste is subjective, a good point to remember when reviewing. Almost ordered the Pasta Rustica which I will try when we return and we will return. My buddy had the eggplant Parmesan and said it was one of the best ever. Not soft and gooey as often prepared. The baked Penne was also very good. For an app we split the Lemon Cilantro Hummus with great herb flatbread. We were going to order 2 of them but Samy said one would be sufficient. $3 and it fed all four of us!. Our total bill with a glass of wine each was less than $60 a couple! I don't want to minimize the complaints others have but I really don't get it. I will agree the waitress could have been more friendly and acted more as a bus boy as Samy took our orders. Some people expect others to be gracious when they are acting like a**holes. Not saying this is the case here but my patience is very thin and if someone is rude or critical of me.....be prepared. Ask my ex-wife LOL. The customer is not always right. Guess I better not open a restaurant"

My Standards:Every business starts with one star ...... GETTING MORE ....... HAS TO BE EARNED."
2008-01-07,jzjcDOIaiJOP5mci0FEStg,"This place has some really good, well-crafted food.   Tucked back in the Scottsdale/Shea shopping center in between the Gelato Spot & the AMC theatre isn't a place you'd really expect to find a good patisserie/ boulangerie, but there you have it.  They have a way of taking normal things like a tukey sandwich (by taking real thick sliced turkey, adding mascarpone, cranberry chutney and dried cherries) or a ham sandwich (well, prosciutto, with brie & granny smith apples) and making them taste extravagant.  They also have a wide selection of very fancy (if not pricey) selections from the bakery.   Be prepared, this place isn't cheap (the only reason I give it 4, not 5 stars).  It's $11-13 for the above mentioned sandwiches, which also include a side salad & fries- errr, pommes frites."
2014-04-17,k0_OJy1YvtxCOyomdtHW4A,My wife and i decided to check it out to give ABC a fare shake.  And im sorry but some of the reviews on here are obviously from people who never stepped into the bistro.  We got their fairly early and the place was empty.  We had the artichoke dip with a flat bread.  Amazing.  It is possibly the best artichoke dip ive every had.  it was great. unlike most artichoke dips this was thicker lots of creamcheese garlic and artichokes topped with diced pepper.  gave it more depth and worked great with the creamy dip.  our entrees were chicken parm and fett alfredo.  both were good the chicken parm had good sauce and lots of cheese. cooked very well. the winner of the two would be the chicken fett alfredo. but both were very good.  they have a full bar which is nice too.the desserts we had to take to go but those were probably a step above most deserts.  very well made. i am not a big sweets person my wife is and she raved about both. i really like mine. but looking at the desserts i dont think you could go wrong with any selection.  for a small casual bistro this is a good place. and clean. nothing i hate more than going into a place and they have gross dirty bathrooms. this place was spotless. so they do show pride in ownership. as we dined more people slowly came in. not a bad crowd and it seemed everyone was happy with their choices. service was spot on. not to fast where it seemed they are trying to rush you out the door. but you never found yourself waiting for anything. after our app it maybe was 3 to 5 min and our entrees showed up.  so very well timed.for a casual bistro 5 stars. super clean. well timed service. and the food is really good.  we will for sure be back again. and also i know sammy gets slammed in the tv show.  he was nothing but nice to us so i can only judge on how our experience was and it was great. For people who actually live here in az...you know how bad service can be. ive been to places in scottsdale where its like you are completely ignored. not here. once you close your menus and are ready to order sammy is right there.  if ABC puts out food like we had. they have nothing to worry about.  let their food do the talking and they will be successful. we will be back again soon.
2013-05-22,k3Ksc__xhCtU6hWlOQeuyA,"Had lunch there today. The place was mobbed, quite a crowd outside...I, too, decided on the Burger. Defiantly NOT worth $15 (what is this, NYC?) It was way overdone, the bun was stale..I am a chef myself and would never, ever, put anything like this past my line and into a customers table.All of the Ballyhoo going on with this place? well, they did it to themselves. Bringing Chef Ramsay into the place could have been a godsend, but they mucked it up and KABLOOEY!! Social media and the Yelper's swarmed on them like crazy Zombies."
2014-01-07,k4M1Sovs05QoLbTvzJ-G2Q,"Me and my husband went to ABC on a limb as we were passing though Phoenix on our way home from to Texas to California.  We were both well aware of the dilemna with kitchen nightmares so we had to check it out.  We ordered a pizza, a jalapeno artichoke dip appetizer, and the blue ribbon burger.  We were surprisingly impressed as the food was super tasty.  My husband loved his burger and he told the owner that he paid the same price for a burger at Gordon Ramsey's BurGR in Las Vegas and that he enjoyed Amy's burger much more!!  My daughter and I enjoyed the pizza and we managed to devour the entire thing...it was Awesome!  I will admit the place is pricey however so we would not go to often even if we lived in Arizona.  I will say you do get what you pay for so if you have the extra money you gotta try this place! '"
2014-05-06,k8VQzr15IB5vFq41djv10g,"My husband and I ate there for lunch today. Had seen Samy and Amy on Dr. Phil. The food had looked amazing and Gordon Ramsey complimented the clean clean kitchen and quality of the deserts. The owners didn't fare so well....So we went today and were blown away by the quality, freshness, and atmosphere!We are foodies, love France for the exquisite foods and wine. We shared the warm spinach salad with crusted goat chees, grilled onions, thick bacon pieces, in a lovely olive oil vinegar estate. We have traveled from France to Napa looking for excellent cuisine. This did not disappoint! Samy and Amy were lovely and welcoming. The atmosphere was very pretty, very French. The deserts are made by Amy and they are works of art. We ended up taking home a piece of key lime pie and a coconut creme concoction..... They were $10 a piece but each desert can feed 2 to 4. DELICIOUS!!!!! We will now become regular patrons....If you are looking for a fast food chain type restaurant this will not be for you. If you love to relax and truly savor your meal then you have struck gold with this little gem!!!"
2014-06-20,kIUZ9Rn4gGKbpvOpAfQVog,"Wow , I went here after seeing the Kitchen Nightmares show. I ordered Baked Gnocchi Bolognese and my friend ordered the blue ribbon burger ... The gnocchi was tough and over cooked and when I ""tried""to send it back the waitress said hesitantly said ok ...within 30 seconds of her going back to the kitchen Samy came out to see who had the gall to send back one of their dishes....sure enough he came over nice at 1st then turned mean and accusing right away !!! We got up and left with him yelling how he was calling the police cause we didn't pay for what we ate ( we had just taken our 1st bites) ...we left never to return !!! I am APPALLED that this ""eatery"" is still open , how do they have customers ? I will never ever go anywhere near this horrible attitude laden place..best of luck Samy , I hope karma comes a knockin soon ....you all have NO business in this industry ......."
2014-08-01,kR5p8iCMlGm-ld-uq0FrwQ,"I wish I could complain about the food, I really do but I can't.  I obviously went because I saw both Kitchen Nightmares episodes and my hubby wouldn't come with me so I went alone.  Sammy greeted me at the front (no other workers were there when I first came in) and he was really pleasant.  I was going to just take dinner to-go but felt like once I was there, I needed to stay there.  It was DEAD ... granted it was a Tuesday night at around 6 pm but there was seriously one other party of 3 and me.  So anyway, I got a huge kick out of the restaurant obviously getting crank called multiple times when I was there (Sammy picked up the phone and said ""who?"" a few times and then said ""Gordon Ramsey??"" and walked to the back of the kitchen.  I was expecting to hear shouts and curses but alas, no such luck.  I could see Amy in the kitchen but didn't really get a good look.  As soon as I thought the show was complete BS, Sammy DID. NOT. STOP. talking about Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon Ramsey, and Ramsey apparently sexually assaulting his wife.  Ummm, what? He went on for a good 20 minutes to the party of 3 in the back of the restaurant and by that time, a hostess had come in so I just caught her eye and asked her if this happens a lot.  She rolled her eyes and went ""every day"".  I mean it was kind of funny because that's why I went there but come on man, I was hoping you'd just yell at me and not talk badly on Gordon Ramsey! haha.  It was a very awkward experience but probably didn't help that I just went on a whim by myself.  I definitely needed someone there to experience it! About the food though --- I got their goat cheese spinach salad and it was delicious.  Next time?  I need to try the pizza they've gotten so many mixed reviews on.  Next time Amy's Baking Company .... next time"
2015-01-23,kbYuKRrNDJlTzzlTrFUtyQ,"First, Samy delivered some two beautiful plates of food. Some breathtaking tapenade and some truly epic lemon garlic hummus, and Amy's fresh made herb flat bread. The bread was warm and delicious, with just the right amount of crunch & chew. Topped off with a hummus that had a real lemon zing to it was a perfect way to wake up our palates.Next we were presented with a Spicy Asian Chicken Salad that was fresh, crunchy, and had just the right amount of spicy goodness to really get our mouths watering. As a contrast to the spicy salad, we were also treated to a Baby Arugula and Pear Salad. This was one of the highlights of the night for me. Samy and Amy have hit a home run of Babe Ruth like proportions with this salad. The fresh pear, dried cranberries and honey citrus dressing danced on our taste-buds like sweet bursts of flavored sunlight. I try not to over embellish but I was almost mad that I had to share this salad with the other guests at our table!Amy had spent the day hand-making pasta for our dinner of Papperdalle, with videos on Instagram to prove it, which came with either a rich and savory Bolognese Sauce, or a light creamy pesto. This was the first time I had ever experienced pasta that didn't come from a box, and I've  got to tell you that it was Earth shattering. The taste is completely different, and I know it was a truly remarkable dish because I couldn't stop smiling as I ate it!We ended the night with coffee & dessert, which if you don't know, is where Amy is a real super star! With a multitude of options, and an endless supply of cakes, pies, and confectionery delights, we wrapped up what was extraordinarily memorable evening."
2014-10-19,koMjzZQ5JdEt98wVf-tziw,"The pizza was under cooked just like Gordon said ,I'll never go back thanks Amy for the raw dough please stay away bad service"
2015-09-29,l6Ue5AMc2ItlM3ZGMCwPzQ,"Amy and Sammy were about as good as it gets. Amy was a magician in the kitchen, her food was the equal of sex. Sorry to see them go. I wish the best for them, I know they wished the best for there customers. Good luck on your next endeavors. We hope to meet you and savor your great food once again!"
2015-05-07,lAFbGzUVgDVtiHSiFGq78Q,"Most disappointing meal ever. The place seems nice at first glance, but we quickly realized that wasn't the case. Owners tried way to hard to impress us, they were all talk. I was served a bland, soggy pizza after about 45 minutes. As soon as our table showed any sort of dissatisfaction the owners acted as if we didn't exist."
2016-02-19,lBzVO-MlMJ9tGeiGU2wSWg,"I went to this place last June on my visit to Arizona. I am sad to see it go, I was aware of the episode on Kitchen Nightmares, but the Amy's Baking Company I went to was completely different. I was met with a warm welcome from Samy and being told to sit where ever I like. He immediately filled my glass with water, and strikes up a nice conversation. The menu was a lot simpler this time around, I came here with my wife, so we decided to try Amy's Lemon Garlic Hummus. It also came with Flat Bread for a couple dollars extra, however when it came, it was outright amazing. The hummus was the perfect consistency, while having the perfect amount of lemon flavor. The flat bread was crispy, fluffy and flavorful. Me and my wife had absolutely adored it. For our main course, my wife orders a Spicy and Sweet Asian Chicken Salad. I ordered a panini with muenster and prosciutto which was outstanding. My wife still talks about the dressing from her salad to this day, it was that good. Time for dessert, the display for desserts looks beautiful. Amy really knows how to make every dessert from scratch and make it taste like a culinary master piece. Me and my wife split the Lemon Tart, the filling was absolutely divine. It was topped with fresh meringue cooked with a flame torch. I was at shock at to how good everything was. I stupidly thought I was gonna come in and be served a subpar meal and be screamed at, but I received the complete opposite. I met Amy who was so delightful, I am sad to see that the restaurant was closed, it is unfortunate that terrible people like Gordon Ramsay had to ruin this place. I wish Amy and Samy the best of luck, and I hope one day I can try Amy's food once more."
2013-06-04,lQPc87-qpJDr0YvLc12Ayg,"Absolutely dreadful. The pizza was under cooked. The salmon burger was raw. When I asked for the pizza and burger to go back, they refused and yelled at me. DO NOT GO."
2014-11-15,lQuzRGJHf9TIXcuJtltIpg,Had lunch this week with some friends.  One I have not seen in 12 years. The service was great and the food delicious. Seriously save room for dessert. You will not be disappointed!  The Lemon Meringue was oh so yummy! Amy does a great job . Will be back if I ever get back that way.
2013-09-08,lSN4njE_Zt72TfAJGIvL8Q,"I took my two year old, MADDIE  for lunch on Friday. The owner greeted us at the door and was very gracious. The server immediately brought a clean high chair to our table. I ordered a pizza and an egg salad sandwich.the pizza was delivered, sliced and cut up for a two year old. she ate a little so we boxed it up. the egg salad was delicious. I make great egg salad and must admit this was excellent. Piled high on a toasted bun, with capers and spices that were becoming to a gourmet egg salad I never had before. The server was attentive and patient with us. a two year old can be demanding, however, the server was responsive and very thoughtful.We paid our Bill and upon leaving, the owner addressed my  Granddaughter affectionately and told us to come back soon.it was a pleasant experience. I will return with friends and husband after a movie. I am not one to get caught up in gossip and media hype. I didn't go there because of it..I basically forgot about it until I was there. Then let the truth bear itself...not looking for anything negative...and MADDIE and I had a great dining experience.to all of you critics ..Shakespere said ""much ado about nothing.""My egg salad was something!!!Continued success..I will be back!"
2013-11-30,lV8n7zbTSNPMyZhB8ej_ow,"I don't know where the people who give this place a positive review ate but, honestly, it couldn't be here. The food is awful. Let me be specific: The Pear Salad was wet and there was nothing organic about the ""field greens"" - Seriously, to say ""organic"" should require some verification that they don't have any preservative wash, etc. The cheese pizza's dough was undercooked and cheese was burnt in a few places.Eggplant in the Parmesan was mush. it appeared to have been frozen.Several people around us complained about the service time and one person had the audacity to suggest the Lobster Ravioli she was having had a bad smell. She was told that if she could pull her nose out of her ass she'd see there was nothing wrong with the lobster smell. Charming!Never saw the infamous Amy - she seemed occupied in the kitchen but not enough to get the food out faster.We won't be back and recommend you don't go."
2013-08-04,lcKj4Alwaw9C9JWfA4HBQQ,"Went for a quick dinner to check out how the business is doing after their abysmal appearance on Chef Ramsay's show. Though I didn't personally experience any of the screaming or arguments, the food here really is terrible. Judging by other reviewers, I would say that either they are lying about how great the food is, or the food here is really just a hit or miss with no way to tell until you actually get your order... Also, just so you guys know, I heard that all the desserts here are not made by Amy. They were bought from other people and sold at the restaurant under her name. Just fyi..."
2014-05-27,lf_uImrag9lBuOJi5mIClQ,"Took the family this afternoon to get Coffee and desert....Had a great experience...Sammy and Amy where awesome,great chatting with you..Looking forward to coming back and trying the Pizza.Anyone going to the restaurant with a biased opinion..shame on you.will confidently recommend the Restaurant to family and friends.Good luck with everything Sammy and Amy and hope all the idiots bullying and harassing you get a life..Karma has an amazing way of showing herself."
2015-03-02,lhp823HY6ny6AwwyZ7hEbA,The desert was the only highlight to my night. everything else was basically raw. makes me wonder are there ANY trained chefs in that kitchen?
2014-03-27,llO82ghaM_864Y86TLd2Pw,Was passing through so we thought we would try the infamous place out. Worst mistake ever. When we ordered and tried to explain we were in a hurry to beat traffic were told we should have went somewhere else. So we did. Stay away!
2014-06-02,loM-vqTJBcLCv2519R1EBw,I couldn't stand the food.  I ordered a pizza but I couldn't eat it because it tasted like cat food on a soggy wet cracker.  I also tried my girl friend Bleu Ribbon Cheeseburger which was horrid.  I was so upset that I paid for overprice poop on a plate.
2012-12-10,mLzqSQqRf8VFLkV8GNTCLA,"If you are going for dinner.....bring some snacks with you... The service is SO POOR you might pass out before you get your order... That is IF you get what you ordered. I'd like to comment on the food, but after waiting 1 HOUR AND 45 MINUTES I left. Very rude owner said they had a computer failure and orders were delayed, but people seated after us got their order?????? They felt sorry for us and offered some of their pizza. However they said it was not good...."
2014-07-31,mRM2TaCCVWc07UX028NVDg,"Went on a Friday afternoon; there was only one other occupied table in the place so we were seated immediately.  It was pleasant and clean inside.  We started with the flatbread and hummus (which the owner made a point of telling us that his wife makes from scratch - ""boils the beans and everything"" - not sure if that is true.)  The flatbread was good, but the hummus was rather bland and could use more garlic and lemon.  And at $5 for the flatbread + $5 for the hummus, it was a bit pricey.Hubby and I got salads - I had the pear salad which was OK; I forgot what he had.  At $12 and $13 each, also a bit pricey for what it was.  Our daughter got the chicken parmesan, which the owner also made a point of telling us that his wife ""makes from scratch by hand.""  I can guarantee, that is NOT true.  The chicken patty was obviously frozen, as it had neither the taste nor texture of freshly prepared chicken.  They probably figure that it's hard to tell with a bunch of sauce and cheese on top.We were going to go ahead and take a couple of desserts home, but at a whopping $10 PER SLICE we decided to pass.  By then we didn't believe that she ""made all of those by hand"" either.  It would be almost impossible for one person to regularly make all of those different desserts from scratch every couple of days.As we were paying, the owner commented on the name on the card and said, ""Oh, Gordon - like Gordon Ramsey"" and we said, ""Uh, yeah...so...?""  Then he said that they were famous and that Ramsey (a professional chef) ""doesn't know anything.""  As soon as we got home we googled the place, read all of the controversy and watched the episode.  It confirmed my suspicions that they lie about making stuff ""from scratch, by hand"" - if they would try to lie to a professional chef about whether or not a dish is frozen (the ravioli), then they certainly would lie to the general public.  The same with the desserts; she does NOT make them all herself.  Makes me wonder about the hummus, too.The lies rolled off of his tongue too easily.  If there's one thing I HATE, it's being lied to by some restauranteur about the food I'm eating."
2015-01-03,mnqTfXJYdIkz_fp-DiGx2w,Awesome food! Awesome owners! Cute restaurant! And the best dessert of my life! Go check Amy's out because you won't be disappointed.
2014-10-23,mubHymhWpfVCAVTjRzgm0A,"We went here while on vacation. An hour wait for food and Amy was sitting out front on her smartphone for at least 20 minutes after we ordered. Apparently her facebook was more important than cooking our food. We heard her yelling at someone in the back for an extended period of time, I'm pretty sure she fired someone as a young server came out crying.Pathetic owner and business."
2013-11-11,n4CKuL3L3GnrmCdWqs-H3Q,I went with my friend one day for dinner and sat down at a tables in the restaurant to eat dinner there because we were hungry and wanted to eats dinner. I ate breads from there and a salads of leafs with dressings on a plate with my fork and so did my friend who came with me to eat dinner there too. All of a sudden it was time for me to eat my hamburgers and my friend ate the same things too. The next things that happened at Amy's was that I wanted to drink waters and a coffee. I can't believe the kind of restaurant.
2015-08-09,n5nPx6XFrB49XmPcF5s33w,"We went to Amys Baking Company for lunch and found that they only have dessert foods. We ordered two different pieces of cake and soda. They had soda by the can no fountain, but Sam waited on us and was very pleasant.  He said that at the end of the month the place is being sold and he and his wife will only sell dessets thru Tomaso's restaurants.   The cake was delicious and Sammy was very pleasant and nice to us. There was a steady flow of customers and they all seemed to love the desserts. Sam said someone from France buying the location but did not say what kind of restaurant or food would be served."
2014-10-05,n8aIAWT3f87eszrvFMNYvw,"This place is FOUL. The food is only slightly nastier than the owners. I was brought here by some freinds I was visiting. We knew going into it the reputation of the place, so we tried to keep it low-profile. We ordered A pizza. An hour and a half later it came to the table looking like someone ran it through the dishwasher. We tried to eat some. We could not. When the owner asked us if we wanted to take it home and we declined, he started mumbling under his breath.  We paid and left but found ourselves being followed to the car by the owner. He only relented when we made it clear that he was about to get his ass STOMPED. Oakland, California...you better ask somebody....Biotch!!"
2014-03-22,nGx5RuKG_NMT3VvNl6BWEQ,My Girlfriend and I are from California but we are in Scottsdale to watch the SF Giants spring training. We were out shopping and decided to stop by the infamous Amys Baking Company. I was really curious about the restraunt because we are a fan of the show Kitchen Nightmares and we saw the episode of when ABC was featured. Even though they both looked insane on the show you can't always believe what you see on tv because of editing and what not. So our visit today was pleasant. No crazy yelling or people getting kicked out. Samy was our waiter and he was very polite. We just had desert because we had already ate acouple of hours before. Amy was behind the dessert counter and explained all the desserts to us. We picked the candy bar cake and it was delicious! I can't say the same about the food because we didn't try it. But as far as the deserts go they are very good. Overall out trip was very good Samy and Amy were very nice.
2014-04-06,nIjulYl-iEL7oy3JkW_GuA,"We have dinner and deserts  four times.   We had lasagna, chicken parmesam , and four various salads.. The food was excellent and very tasty.  The deserts were  the best that I ever had.,  The decor of the restaurant was beautifu and romanticl.  All four of us had a wonderful dining experience.BR"
2014-05-17,nJSeDJH8YQpL_wGvgDma2Q,"A few years ago after attending a movie across from this restaurant, my mom, her friend and I peeked in the door of Amy's Baking Co.  We were a little hungry and wanted to see what they had to offer. The minute we looked into the door we were met by the owner who told us he did not want us to come in because we would not buy anything.  REALLY!!! NO LIES HERE!I am not sure why these people are in the people business. They should not even work with animals. They are downright rude.If I could give 0 stars or a negitive that would make more sense. If you see this place when passing just keep going. Scottsdale has way too many restaurants to put up with nasty people."
2012-10-14,nKDKosdramEN5bz6iAZF2A,"This was a cultural charm. Good atmosphere, authentic furnishings and one of the best caesar salads. The place was empty but intimate.  The desserts looked promising but we were late for a movie and the owner/server reminded me to slow down to enjoy my half-eaten onion soup which was not the best. Seasoned fresh flat bread was also notable; however, it would have been improved with a tri-sample of hummus or even dipping oil. One thing about owner/servers I don't like is tipping them. I would have rather liked to see the busboy pick up the extra money."
2014-04-17,nNKxnbcqyys5PY_8ZZy5YA,"My wife and I walked in with an open mind to give Amy's Baking Company a try even though I do agree with Amy herself, don't feed off what everyone is saying about the restaurant through the media or what's posted online. GO IN AND TRY IT YOURSELF!! I personally was hoping that the food would be amazing. Here are my thoughts as followed.First, the restaurant looks great. Very Clean but Samy Bouzaglo gives me and my wife the creeps.Second, the food and desert were good but nothing extraordinary.It is a pricey restaurant but not worth my money to return.Doesn't give discounts to Current Military Servicemen."
2014-07-01,nWGHSukw5OFnxFmjOgBE4g,"I believe the pictures in this post will do most of the talking for me, but I have to tell you guys about my recent experience at Amy's Baking Company. Michelle and I didn't know where we wanted to have lunch so we drove around for a bit and then once I remembered we were super close the the Kitchen Nightmare's restaurant, we decided it needed to be checked out. When we pulled into the parking lot, we immediately whipped out our phones as if we had arrived at some sort of tourist attraction(the circus, perhaps).  Samy greeted us as the host(he was also our waiter, and the bus boy...actually, he was the only person in the front of the house). He was extremely accomodating, a little bossy..but not in a rude way. It was more in a ""I have to make sure you are not let down, do as I say so you will be pleased"" manner. Either way, he was very endearing and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Michelle and I decided we wanted to try a few different things so we started off with House Salads, tossed with cherry tomatoes and a lemon dill salad dressing that was absolutely PERFECT and refreshing.  The salad was bright, cool, and also I might add, HUGE. It would be a perfect entry if you added a protien. We also ordered the hummus, which we were practically licking out of the bowl when Samy came back with our Pizza.  The Pizza was the item we were most nervous about. If you've seen the Kitchen Nightmare's episode on ABC then you will remember it was soggy, under cooked, and an utter disapointment. We chose the Pear, Fig, Procuitto pizza, and when Samy set it down, we could tell it was cooked to perfection. It was absolutely beautiful and we couldn't praise it enough.  All of the flavors blended together in perfect harmony, and although we were so full, we could not.stop.eating. Samy was a bit taken back by the fact that these two small girls were NOT indeed ready for the bill like he had imagined we would be, but were ready to head inside to inspect the dessert case. Amy's desserts are impeccable. She likes sparkly things, and there is edible shimmer lust on about three quarters of the options, but we were just on cloud nine from our delicious lunch that the sparkly treats seemed fine. We picked a chocolate truffle type cake (I regret that I can not remember what it was called). You know those small chocolate truffle balls?? This was like one of those, but the size and shape of a slice of cake. It was literally only possible to eat like, two bites MAX, but I'm not complaining! When we were all done and paid(and tipped..sorry, couldn't help myself) Samy, he walked us back inside and went to get Amy from the kitchen to introduce us. She was SO pleasant, and thanked us for coming in expressed her gratification at our kind words. Also, SHE IS GORGEOUS. I don't know how somebody can work in a hot kitchen for hours on end and walk out looking FLAWLESS. Anyways, this was long and disorganzied but if you made it all the way through, my suggestion is to go give Amy's Baking Company a shot. Michelle and I can't help but feel as though the show was totally fake. We left questioning everything we thought we knew, about everything."
2013-09-15,nsM4MOnAfTrK0zcSDflGrw,"I actually suspect that a lot of people who have written reviews about this place didn't actually eat here. The perfect reviews aren't accurate because the food isn't amazing (and I'll explain why) and the bad reviews are clearly people who watched the show and thought it would be funny to write a silly review. I'm attaching a picture of myself and Samy to show I was actually there. Here's my experience: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8pm. They don't open until 5 so I figured this would be a good time in case they got busy.  I  got a call from Samy a little later to ask me if I could make my reservation for 7:30 because their kitchen closed at 8. I accepted but thought - you're only open for 3 hours? Already off to an odd start. So my friend and I arrive and we are literally the only people in there. Soon after Samy joined us and asked if we had seen the show. He seemed like he was trying very hard to be friendly - and I give him a lot of credit for putting in the effort. He proceeded to ask if I had seen the show. I said yes but lamented that I know reality tv can make things seem worse than they are and I'm just here to see for myself. I said the only thing on the show that bothered me that didn't have an excuse was not giving the servers their tips. This was a soft spot for him. He has a very intense personality - almost like he's constantly close to trying to take a swing at you. He explained that he STILL doesn't give the servers their tips, but pays them $14 an hour. I said I've worked in the service industry and I would much rather make minimum and get my tips. He then went on to explain that he's never been sued, Gordon Ramsy has, they they're getting a reality show, and so forth. He left us and I ordered the Blue Ribbon burger (to try what was in the show) and my friend got the ravioli. The burger was as sloppy as you saw in the show, but I didn't particularly mind. The problem I had with it though is that by combining blue cheese, aioli, truffle oil, etc. it made it INSUFFERABLY salty. Same thing with the ravioli - they used cured prosciutto so it was also totally salty. I couldn't taste any other flavors. Just salt. For desert we had the flour-less chocolate cake. I have a theory about the deserts - I think someone else makes them off site and she adds some toffee frosting. There was also glitter on it. Apparently edible glitter exists....who knew but I still felt strange ""eating"" it. We got the bill and they tried to push t-shirts on us. I politely passed, which was uncomfortable. I'm going to give them three stars because I could tell despite their personality, they were trying really hard to be pleasant. I probably will not go back though."
2013-07-02,nu0JMOwN3vYUACJT4QL6rQ,"While in Phoenix for business recently, I decided to try ABC. I'd seen the ""Kitchen Nightmares"" episode, and if for no other reason, was curious to see if it was indeed as bad as the show had portrayed it.It wasn't very busy. There were probably two or three other parties there when we were. We waited just a little while, but not too long to place our order. When we did, Sammy was very nice. He gave us his personal recommendation for the meatball pizza.We only waited about 10 to 15 minutes before our pizza was out and on the table. It wasn't an hour long horror story like I've seen others on here write. The pie was nice and hot. when it arrived.The pizza itself wasn't that bad, but certainly not the best I've ever had. I thought the crust was a bit too thin, and would've liked it to either be more crispy if it was that thin, or just a little thicker. I also thought there was a just a touch too much garlic on the pizza, but it was still not bad.It was quite the experience. I thought it was a little weird that the servers couldn't handle money or take our order, but they could fill our water and bring our food out, but if that's what works for Sammy and Amy, then that's what works.Overall, not as bad as portrayed on the show. It was an interesting experience and the food wasn't terrible."
2015-06-01,o4L-zqYBqVXGnLZva4DXfg,service was decent but the food was bad and over priced. at least my water was cold.the paninI was over chrunchy and soggy at the same time. should have just went to Mcdonald
2013-06-03,oLMw1Sh29qulzam6lFl84w,"We went in expecting a disaster. The food was good and there were plenty of people on staff that were attentive and friendly, a huge improvement than what we saw on Kitchen Nightmares. We all tried something from each section and we were all pleased, the desserts were great and nothing was greasy or undercooked. I think that Ramsey did a great job with his advising. Even though it didn't go well, you can see the real improvement"
2018-06-24,oNJdDBYYXmKQWwhxdAOgVw,Been there and the food is terrible! My father told them that the ravioli was cold and rotten and the owner ( Sammy I think his name was?) told us that we don't know what we are talking about and told us to f**k off and also that his wife's food is delicious. This was a few years ago by the way
2013-05-23,oUMn4865OWprHfMirt5zAQ,best pizze I ever had went in with friend while in area awesome food and super friendly
2013-05-29,oVlQectSG7WLtVAqYLunMg,"Food was alright I definetely had better, the pizza had a weird tangy taste. Over all it was a good lunch."
2013-07-07,oWjZJf-EfpBeoPJJNT8VGA,"After seeing the disaster on Kitchen Nightmares, my wife and I were very intrigued.  We went here on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM and the restaurant was at about 20% capacity.  Samy was very nice and even Amy smiled at us from the kitchen.  Our server was almost too nice if that is possible.  It was very clean, which is why I couldn't, in good conscience, give it 1 star.  I ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza and my wife had the spinach and goat cheese salad.  Hers was average and mine was fairly weak.  The middle was soggy dough and needed to be eaten with a fork.  It also had pesto sauce on it which was very much overkill.  We got the dessert to go which was some white chocolate/coconut pie deal.  Not very good at all.  When we left the restaurant, there were 5 other patrons at what should have been the busiest time of the week.  Samy and Amy were seated at a table near the front since there were no more meals needing to be made.  She was scanning on her iPad probably reading reviews.  In all honesty, my wife and I kind of felt bad for them.  If only they could have swallowed their pride and let Gordon Ramsay do his thing it would probably would have been a huge success.  Instead, they are empty on Saturday evenings and will probably be out of business in the not too distant future...too bad..."
2014-04-05,o_plt_cBwVmLZulN3xcaWg,"Ate here and had a great experience. Tasty desserts and great chai latte. I don't watch much TV and never reality TV so I had no idea they had been on a show til reading reviews here afterward.  Still don't understand the premise of the show, but I would be lying if I said I cared. Service was friendly and quick, enjoyed sitting and sipping, and though I don't live around the corner I will be sure and visit again when I'm down there."
2014-01-17,opf55qEuCusr7p9Ri2Cz8w,"Came in with my father in between lunch and dinner hour (3ish) and was seated on the patio by the owner/ server. He is a very fun guy and seemed very accommodating. He really went into detail about the different ingredients of all of the pizzas after we were unsure of what one to order. We said we wanted something a little bit different than the usual fast food pizza and so we chose the fig pizza. We ordered the small since it was just two of us after he advised us that they are actually pretty big and he did not want us to over order( which shows us he actually cares and isnt just a greedy guy). The pizza arrived promptly and it was a beauty. You can really tell just by looking at is that everything is made from scratch. The crust was soft but firm and the pizza was thin and cooked crispy and perfect. The flavor contrast with the sour cheese and sweet onion and fig were to die for. Overall the experience could not have been better, A+ service and food. The only two things I care about when dining out. Also it is right across from the movie theater which would be good before or after a movie. I would definitely recommend and will definitely be back if I am on that side of town again."
2014-04-19,oq8dcmqzvxf8a6c6FUY3sA,"I've seen the episode on kitchen nightmares and I just couldn't believe that Gorden didn't fix it so I went to see for my self, it was 90 min in to service and my appetizer didn't come so I went to to the conter than they started swaring at me!DO NOT GO THERE!"
2015-05-17,p5dv1BTeh3T4hVyFYp6vxA,"Wanted to check this place out to see if the crazy was really crazy, got there at 6:30, hours say they are open till 9, but guess they weren't in the mood to stay open, cuz the owner said they were closing when we walked in...I guess the food really does suck cuz every restaurant around them was super busy...sad..."
2014-07-03,p7MDgbNXrAHkbiIznw0DtQ,Visiting town this was horrible. I asked for a remake on my burger got yelled at and treated like a 5 year old. I walked out and they followed me out demanding payment.
2014-01-25,p7W-M8BdZ1Z_T0jiw1602w,"ABC has become a weekly stop. We came after watching Kitchen Nightmares because although I am ashes to admit it our curiosity got the best of us. What we found was a pair of passionate owners who put their heart and soul into their restaurant and they do an amazing job. The food is fantastic, the ambiance is great and the desserts are to die for! Amy is a baking genius. Her candy bar tart is a toffee chocolaty piece of heaven in a bite. Sammy is super friendly and courteous and has welcomed us like long lost friends since our first visit. We fell in love with this place and Sammi and Amy - it is our new favorite place!"
2013-07-30,pI-QGfJbMUeJAE6z6Spiow,I ate there.I am pickyThe food? Lets say I rather swallow vomit then eat there again.Pizza? Soft and chewyBurger? Gross it was like a sponge. And yes the owner is a clown.
2014-08-05,pL_iaiUfRRKo-JOvGiW2-A,"Well what can I say, that has not already been said.  Don't eat here.  Unless you want to experience the poor service and below average food.  If you go there do not order the BBQ Chicken Mango.  I don't know what they were going for but it failed.  There was a off taste to the mango and chicken.  Maybe it was the sauce."
2013-09-15,pe3AX1Mw9HCcngmjl02Nxw,"I love Gordon Ramsay! I came here a couple weeks ago for an early dinner with my friends more out of curiosity than anything. Food: Lox Smoked Salmon Salad: egh. Not worth the $14 -- 4 slices of lox, a crustini and greens topped with a dressing that was not very good. I also bit into something really hard and unidentifiable that completely turned me off. I did not have another bite after that. Vegetarian Mediterranean Pizza: It had spicy peppers, red onions, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, basil pesto, feta and mozzarella on it. I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. It was just the right amount of heat, and I liked the combination of the veggies and sauces. Crust wasn't anything special, but overall, a good pizza.Chocolate Ganache/Mousse cake: TO DIE FOR! Gordan Ramsay had this cake on the show, and it was the one thing he actually liked. It was amaaaazing. So rich and just the right amount of sweetness/slight bitterness of the chocolate. Love, love, love! I ordered one of these to take home too. A bit pricey at $10, but worth it for a once in a while treat. Service: Samy was very polite -- I do appreciate that he is really trying his hardest to give good customer service. So I was content with the service. He greeted us warmly and was very courteous the entire night. Our waitress was nice too. I was a little put off that she was trying to sell us shirts at the end of the dinner though....lol I don't know I just thought that was a bit forward. The only glimpse of Amy I saw was her scurrying about in the kitchen in the back. Overall: Not a bad experience. Definitely a bit too pricey and the question still remains as to whether all the desserts, including the one I loved, were actually made on-site, but who knows. They're trying their best to recover from the shit show they portrayed on Kitchen Nightmares, and from what we experienced, it seems like a big improvement."
2013-07-07,phAHGz2Fr5io4K6uZ6HzrA,"WOW! Of course I went here as I was in AZ on a business trip, and was staying not far from this place. I was in my hotel room (thinking about just ordering room service), when someone I knew had posted a comment about the Kitchen Nightmare episode on FB. I then decided to look up the episode on HULU (this was not long after airing), then realizing I was not far from there, I decided to go. Uggg... I could tell just walking in that the kitchen was in distress. The old guy was sweating like a fat man in a marathon behind the touch screen computer. He had several tickets in his hand, and was having trouble with the technology. There were shouts from the back and a lot of loud banging from the kitchen. I noticed only one table had their entrée. That table seem unimpressed with their food. one other table got some appetizer shortly after I was seated, I heard one person remark ""will I have to wait another 45min for my dinner"" The time frame got my attn., because it looked like a simple pita and hummus type appetizer.The old man responded curtly to this comment but with his accent I could not understand what he said. When he left the table, the group kinda snickered. There were like 2-3 other groups/couples waiting that just had drinks. My waitress was very polite, and attentive she kept my glass full. I noticed she stayed away from a couple tables, until someone asked her to fill their water glass. She did as asked, and the old man noticed and scolded her telling her that they were HIS customers, and she is NOT to serve them. Even when the customer tried to explain to him that he just wanted some water, the old man responded ""You do not tell me how to run my business! I am the boss here you are not.. if you want water you have to come through me, not her..."" I then realized why she avoided those tables. My order was taken... I ordered the Chicken Parm. I waited for a while, even though I fully intended to, I forgot to mark the time I placed my order, but it seemed like an eternity when I did start clocking (I imagine 15-20min later) still the waitress was kind, and kept my glass full. about 30 min later the old man placed and Eggplant Parm in front of me. He was still sweaty, and had some strong odors about him. At this point my sense of humor was thin, and when he placed the wrong dish in front of me I called him on the fact that I was her customer and not his. He argued with me insisting that he took my order for an Eggplant Parm. The table kinda caddy corner from me actually got up, and informed him that THEY had ordered that dish over an hour ago, and that they herd me order the Chicken parm. The old man continued to argue till the waitress had to confirm my order with the original hand written ticket. I will say at that point, the old man said ""I am sorry, but you know how it is... it is confusing..."" The other customer and I rolled our eyes he sat at his table with his wife (who had no food in front of her) and I returned to waiting. Well I got my meal the same time the other gentleman's wife got hers - about 15min later. My meal was an undercooked chicken that was supposed to be baked, but somehow was greasy. and when I mean undercooked, the thick part of the chicken was RAW, BLOODY RAW! It was NOT crispy the breading was soggy, mostly from the weird pasta situation. It looked as if they used a non slotted spoon to pull the pasta from the pot, because there was A LOT of water on my plate. and I am not sure the physics behind this, but somehow, they managed to have both overcooked and undercooked pasta on my plate. As if they cooked left over pasta, with new (dry) noodles! Some of the pasta was like mush, and some of it was crunchy. This meal could have killed me had I eaten it!The other couple was served the Eggplant Parm, then 15 min later she was served (I think it was a salad ) As a gentleman would, he did not start his meal till his wife was served. When they started eating the wife threw her fork on the plate and said, I can't take another bite of this $%!+ ! The husbands eyes and mine caught each others. He came to my table with his plate in hand. He asked me to taste his Eggplant Parm. I tried to cut his Eggplant Parm, but it was REAL tough, I managed to get a small piece, and it tasted like dirt - literally! We both took our complaint to the old man, and he started arguing with us concerning the quality of his food. I pointed out the blood, he said ""Good! Hope it kills you, then you will never bother me again"". The other couple slipped out, didn't pay the check (don't blame them) but that left me - the old man insisted that I not only pay my tab, but the other couples too. I pulled out a $20, threw it on the table and left! I was chased out the restaurant by both of them. I went to the Pita Jungle and had a much more positive experience there (The other couple was there when I arrived with a full meal in front of them. This place is a HECK NO!"
2013-11-23,piy-0dSRvD9nTHoUSWeAGw,"Like most people, I went in for the curiosity factor after the whole Kitchen Nightmares deal.  I was pleasantly surprised. Sammy was very friendly and very accommodating.  I had a tomato/basil potato gnocchi which was very good and flavourful - although a little too much sauce.   I also tried a gluten-free chocolate truffle (which cutely enough, said MEOW on it!) which was ridiculously GOOOOD!  I would definitely go back."
2013-06-07,pqgBc-pxzDambJMhqS9_CQ,"Let me be honest first, only came here because I wanted to see all the fighting and screaming.Now onto the foodOrdered: BBQ Chicken Mango Thoughts: Blah under cooked very doughy Expectations: Waiting to have the pizza thrown in my faceOverall: It is what everyone else says its just blah food wasn't very good and for the price just don't see the point.But please if you are going to be side show have that going on, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary here. If you want to have business be that side show that people come to see and make your money now then close like you will in the next few months."
2010-08-05,pyc_OhiZOQTR4Lf54X3myA,"Food was decent but was not impressed, drive to Casanova Brothers in Mesa......"
2018-06-14,qPFZD7HQxaPjY59ST9voag,This place was horrible. Great food but bad service. Been here many times.  Felt bad for the people who worked here.  Lots of drama. But good food. So that's why 1 star
2014-03-07,qPLFIHkuiTuq6doC8Un2jA,I had to give it a star.  I want to give it a minus but they don't have a minus rating.I had the pizza and it was pretty bad. Sammy did ask me how the food was but if he looked at my plate I think that was easy to see as I only ate a portion of it.
2015-05-04,qXeDBrDq_Pea7Wbd2l3pYQ,"Ok...so....I'm usually very quick to give bad reviews to places I've eaten at. Noone cares about good service AND food anymore! But I just can't be negative today. (I know...it hurts me too) We stopped by here on our way through Scottsdale on a Friday morning at around noon. The place has a LOT of seating but was completely empty. We didn't have time to stop and eat- but were more interested in the bakery items up front. The case wasn't too large but held a good amount of delicious looking desserts. Samy was very nice in explaining the desserts/flavors to us. We ended up with the bread pudding and a slice of cream filled layered chocolate cake. $10 a dessert. Somewhat pricey- but they appeared to be well made, so it's worth a try, right?The chocolate cream filled layered cake was delicious. My husband and I agreed that it was the best cake we've ever had. Super flavorful and thick without being TOO rich. I wish I would've gotten more!The bread pudding was good, but the cake was better ;) I think the walnuts in the bread pudding threw it off for me. But others might prefer it. Either way- both desserts were very quality  and definitely worth the stop. If their dessert is that good, I wonder how their FOOD is. Next time I'm in the area- I'll definitely be giving it a try.I guess my only suggestion would be to change the red sign on the outside of the place. It's so tacky and generic and doesn't really fit the feel of what they're trying to go for on the inside. A black sign with white font might be more attractive...Either way- great job on the desserts- delicious!***EDIT*** I REALLY hope Samy and Amy open up another location. It makes me super sad to see they're closed. I'm moving to the Phoenix area within the next couple months and was really hoping to make this one of my regular stops :( Boo."
2010-08-01,qiTy11I-yp6foxIghRfGOA,"In retrospect, I should have known better than to step foot into Amy's Baking Company (a.k.a. ABC Bistro).  -8 pm on a Saturday night, three tables are occupied-a sign on the door indicates they're looking for an experienced line cook, a dishwasher, waitresses, you name it-Pita Jungle, just a stone's throw away, is packed to the gillsThese are all bad signs.  They go ignored, however, because I'd eaten one thing all day, and I had drove here to try their pizza.  Never, ever again.The waitress brings me out a water and a menu to my table for one  on the patio, which I had all to myself.  Browsing the apps, I was pleasantly surprised to see several things priced $3, which seemed like a bargain, given the high price of everything else.  $3 tapanade sounded like a good deal, but I was informed that it didn't come with anything - it was $3 extra for bread.  Since I was solo, I decided to skip it and instead pay $14 for their 12"" margherita pizza.  About three minutes later, the waitress drops off my pizza.  ""Your pizza"", she says, leaves a plate and off she goes.  I sat for a moment, confused as to how things happened so quickly.  I try to grab a slice of the pizza, but it was so blazing hot that I wasn't even going to attempt to handle it.  I waited for a few minutes to let it cool off, only to discover that not only had it cooled enough to handle, but was actually well-cooled and most likely reheated.  After a closer inspection of the pie in front of me, it was evident that it had been reheated, as there were smaller tomatoes that had spent their time in the oven, and larger tomatoes that had barely been kissed by the heat of the oven.I took a bite, and was immediately underwhelmed.  The crust had very little character, was slightly sweet but had that store-bought quality to it.  The pesto tasted okay, but the tomatoes were completely tasteless and overall, it just fell flat.  It's margherita - the ingredients need to shine to make such a simple pizza.  These ingredients were sub-par.  After two small pieces, I decided I was wasting my calories and just gave up on it.So I sat outside, not eating, and sat.  And sat.  Where the hell was the waitress?  I glanced inside a few times, hoping to catch her eye, but she must have been occupied elsewhere.  The owner comes out.  ""How'd you like your pizza?""  Instead of immediately responding, I asked how it had come out so quickly.  In short, he told me another table had ordered it, decided they didn't want it, and it sat in the kitchen for two minutes, who in turn decided to send it out to me since I didn't order anything else.  Me: ""Well, it didn't really taste fresh"".Him: ""No, no, our pizzas are the best.  Ask our customers.  You're the first person since we've opened to ever not like our pizzas"".  He got very defensive about the pizza, but I hadn't really launched a harsh criticism on the pizza, just said I didn't really enjoy it.  So I sat some more, with an empty drink, and realized they wanted me gone.  The owner wouldn't make eye contact with me.  The server never came back out asking if I wanted something else.  And they still hadn't refilled my drink.So I sat on a patio, alone, and decided to have a smoke.  The waitress comes out...Her: ""Sir, there's a no smoking sign over there, I was told to tell you to not to smoke here.""  Me: ""Is this the last f*** you in this experience?""Her: ""Yes, I think so"".She walks away.  I walk inside, pay the bill, and leave.  No apologies, no discounts on the bill, nothing.  $18 for weak iced tea and shitty pizza.This is arrogance in its worst form.  I can forgive bad food, but I cannot forgive misplaced arrogance and the blatant dismissal of a customer, whether you agree with them or not.  Perhaps the sign on the door should also say, ""Wanted: New owner"".  I cannot, for the life of me, recommend this restaurant to anyone.---UPDATE:Since Yelp's 5000 character limit will not let me post the full response by the owner (Amy B.), here is a link to the comments:blogs.phoenixnewtimes.co…"
2013-08-11,qpZjFAyY2jUEVs2KtCnryQ,"People, I went here because I saw Kitchen Nightmares and I had the pizza. The crust was crispy and the pesto was a nice addition. Their dessert was phenomenal. I talked to Samy a little bit because I was curious of their side of the whole Kitchen Nightmares ordeal. Now. Samy doesn't steal the tips nor does he control the POS. Amy is a total sweetheart and Samy was funny. They care about the patrons and their employees. You people are judging based on a TV show that edits tons of footage they don't like out. Before you judge actually go to the restaurant and interact. I mean yeah its hit and miss with the food but I had nothing to complain about am I being paid? No. Don't assume so because I can prove I'm not. All in all I recommend this place  and haters really just need to not judge a book by its cover. They are just trying to make it in life leave them alone."
2013-05-29,rCsJT2GNm-gxTh6HK3CLmg,"I recently moved out to Arizona, and I have to say in my almost 24 years of living, I have never come across such horrible service.  Waited nearly 4 hours for a pizza, and then it was raw dough in the middle.  I came here because I wanted to see if Chef Ramsay was correct in his opinion, and it has been proven correct.  I assure you I am  not a ""hater""."
2014-04-24,rFWLBgsHdNF99L9p5NwzxA,"I had hummus and a pizza.  The pizza was doughy and had a lot of flour on the pan which made it odd to eat. If the excess flour wasn't there then it would have been easier to eat and tasted better. It had an excellent aroma too it. The hummus was ""okay."" If I went back I wouldn't order it again, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either."
2014-08-13,rGPko7_O9gXt2hJ60YogoQ,"Unbelievable. I've never been verbally attacked WHILE being begged for money like this before, and I'm from NYC. I honestly believed that me and my boyfriend were going to get into a physical altercation if we didn't pay for food that we never got. That poor waitress that was incredibly kind and apologetic... I'm glad they never actually received our money, and I hope that they never receive yours.I understand that they aren't always like this, and that they are often extremely accommodating and hospitable, but that doesn't at all excuse their poor behavior to others. Every time someone experiences something like we did, it should basically void a hundred good experiences of others.I can't really review the food, since I never got to try it. All I can wish for is that we never experience something like this again.Please, dear reader, take every ""positive"" review you read here with a grain of salt."
2013-09-29,rLKtFWJpeEWwja18Avhchw,I came here because I wanted to see if it was going to be as big of a shit storm as it was on tv....It was.I think the people that gave it 4 or 5 stars expected to eat poop... Yeah the food was 2.5 starts but there is still awful service and the owners are yelling all of the time. And it still took 3 hours to eat crappy pasta and a piece of dry chocolate cake.
2017-07-19,rS0oNCIGi35gnLzTr4PG1w,"I'd give this place zero stars but its not possible , i ordered the pizza and it was effing raw! after waiting an hour for my pizza and complaining for the wait the owners screamed at me and told me to pay and get the eff out! after refusing to pay for something i did not eat i was kicked out and threatened to have the police on me . horrible service , they refuse to give there servers tips. wouldn't recommend"
2014-11-01,rSoi7mHxerAWh5WdyAOm7g,Super super yum... Great to have a nice lunch and catch up with a friend ... Will be back again soon!
2014-12-18,rh8oK6Olu73gWXwNj0o1MA,"Visiting from Saskatchewan, Canada. Familiar with the hype + Gordon Ramsey episode. Decided to give the place a try and form our own opinions.Had the artichoke dip and tapenade with flatbread. Probably the most unique, interesting, and tasty artichoke dip I've ever had. Tapenade was great but nothing to write home about. Great flatbread.I had the french pressed coffee -  could have been a little stronger for my taste. Girlfriend had an americano, likes her coffee strong, but said it was a little too much.Would have loved to take in a full meal but didn't have the time. Hope to come back some day.Service was great, though we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time. Amy and Sammy went out of their way to get a picture with us after the meal. Very kind and gracious."
2013-08-01,rkj2N4Pb3h32l9yz9R1WWw,"We stopped by for a early dinner / some snacks to bring back to the hotel and was greeted with an open door and friendly staff even a few minutes before the posted hours of operation.We loved the artichoke jalapeño dip and flatbread, the pizza was wonderful, and the desserts were perfect. To the complainers who haven't been there; just go and check the place out for yourself. I'd definitely go again and would recommend this restaurant."
2016-01-17,rnToo2izMk5sv2IUyRkAzQ,"Went there once for a meet up with some of my friends who were locals, I was visiting from out of another city, I asked if any of my food was frozen, they told me no, when I got my ravioli, it was frozen, I didn't eat it and sent it back, my friends and I went to leave and they demanded I pay for my food, but I didn't eat anything, I was the only one who ordered anything as my friends already ate, they wouldn't let us leave threatening to call the police on us if we didn't pay for our food, but I was the only one who ordered, they called the police, the police came, they escorted me out, and I left with my friends. the reason I went was because I didn't think it was that bad, I thought they were playing it up for the cameras, but I was so very wrong, it is not played up at all, these people really are crazy!"
2015-04-22,s1XSu3IfU8p02QIGGl-dKg,"Haven't had a chance to try out the new lunch menu yet, but their desserts are spectacular. I came in to judge for myself and had the best slice of chocolate cake I've ever had. Brought several family members in since who can't get enough. Amy and Samy are very kind. When we came last week for my birthday, Samy brought my cake out with a candle and sang happy birthday to me. Come give their desserts a try for sure, you won't be disappointed!"
2013-05-23,s9Js0WmdgauUJkBDxmiMiQ,"Cakes look good, but are to sweet.  The wait for the food just made me upset. Staff was very apologetic but I just paid for the cake I actually got and left.  I was not willing to wait more then 45 min for a pizza.  After watching the show and hearing that it might not come out after an hour!  I'm glad I left, the gagster not gangster tried to be rude to me but he knew not to touch me.  I hope this place turns around and please give your staff the tips they deserve and it legally belongs to them.  I ended up eatting at the Pita Jungle which is not to far away. I got my food in 10 mins."
2013-05-26,sAJ6sCxwFWJfnIL-uic-pA,"When playing the lottery, we trade a small sum of money for a little excitement -- for the anticipation of experiencing an uncertain but potentially fabulous outcome.  In the wake of Amy's Baking Company's legendary social media implosion, I saw stopping by ABC for dinner as something like playing the lottery.  One could possibly witness the ""fireworks"" for which ABC has become so famous, be asked to leave after complaining about the food, or simply enjoy a decent plate of food... in any case, there's no way to lose too horribly.  In my estimation, the price of a drink, an appetizer, and an entree is a very reasonable price to pay for some exhilarating uncertainty.As a preface, I should add that I tried stopping in for lunch.  Their posted business hours seem a bit flexible now, as they were closed at 12:30pm and had a sign posted saying that they would re-open at 5pm.Upon entering about 20 minutes after they opened for dinner, I was immediately greeted by a very polite hostess.  The hostess gave me the kind of look that two friends exchange after one friend has experienced a deep personal loss, before broaching the subject of the loss in conversation.  As I was being seated, Samy came to my table and instructed the hostess how to properly seat someone who is dining alone (my girlfriend, a culinary professional in Scottsdale, refused to come with me to her credit).  He told me that his staff are all new to their jobs, and he apologized for any inconvenience -- I assured him that the hostess was doing her job very well, and he happily took that compliment.My order was taken promptly by a gregarious server, and I did not have to wait long at all for my appetizer (roasted red pepper hummus and flatbread) to arrive.  The flatbread was cooked evenly and to the correct consistency, and the hummus was flavorful and balanced.  My entree (fettuccine alfredo) arrived maybe fifteen minutes after the appetizer.  The sauce was wonderful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, though the dish was drowning in sauce.  I don't mind this at all as the flatbread helped me to make short work of whatever sauce didn't reach my mouth with the pasta, though I'm sure others would prefer a smaller alfredo/fettuccine ratio.While enjoying my food, Samy and my server checked on me several times without being too intrusive, with the exception of the guy who asked three times if I wanted my hummus and flatbread boxed.I'm sure that I'll receive some nasty messages for writing a generally positive review of ABC, but it would be dishonest of me to misrepresent my experience.  As I walked out the door after finishing my food, I thanked Samy for the enjoyable meal and wished him and his wife the best.  ABC clearly hit bottom recently, and one can only hope that they have learned from their very serious mistakes and are now committed to providing their staff and their customers with a better experience.  From the negative reviews provided by others since last week's re-opening, it appears that they still have lots of work to do -- though from my experience tonight, perhaps they are on the right track."
2015-03-10,sDJV8pU3zSOaLK_uBwS18Q,"We came to Arizona for Spring training and decided to dine at Amy's Baking Company. We ordered the following items from the menu: spaghetti bolognese, ham and cheese panini, arugula and goat cheese salad, and the chicken salad sandwich. Wow!!! Each dish was superb!!! It was the best spaghetti we've tasted and each dish was extremely delicious!!! Samy and Amy were charming, friendly, attentive, and a joy to get to know. They are both passionate about their restaurant and it's proven with their dishes, desserts, and its cleanliness.Passion, intensity, and drive should be viewed as positive traits. Thank you Samy and Amy for an exceptional dining experience!!!"
2013-06-08,sJUFwJNXbV5dU7H9Ymc1UQ,"Like one of the last reviewers, I am not paid and this review is honest based on my experience tonight. I'm from California, but I went to Amy's Baking Co. while visiting my mother who lives in Fountain Hills. We were skeptical at first and you can tell when you enter the restaurant that the show has had a major impact on the place. Nevertheless, the food and service were both top-notch. Perhaps they're compensating for the negativity generated by the show, but I will certainly be going back for the food--which was delicious.We arrived when they were opening and were the first customers of the night. We were greeted by a waiter who asked us if we would like a dessert or were there for a meal. We told him that we were there for a meal and he sat us. We were quickly approached by a waitress that took our drink order. When questioned, she indicated that it was her third day.I ordered a burger without some of the dressings that normally come on it. Samy came over to clarify my order, so I think he is still in exclusive control of the POS system. We ended up having a conversation and he was nothing but nice the whole time. The burger came after about 10 or 15 minutes. It was fantastic--exactly how I ordered it, fresh, and made of what tasted like high-quality beef.Samy and the waitress checked in with us regularly to make sure we were enjoying our meal. My mother and I both complimented the food, which we were honestly enjoying. Amy came out and waved and told us ""Thank you"" and that she was glad we were enjoying the experience. It was pretty cool of them.We paid up, Samy shook our hands, and we left to go see a movie next door. We went back after the movie for dessert. I ordered a cake that had candy and an oreo cookie crust. It is one of the best cakes I've ever had (at least top five). I strongly recommend ABC and I intend to go back next time I'm in town."
2015-04-11,sKvfdJTCyGTC8Gt_uqmdag,"I will NEVER eat at ABC ever again! The food was absolutely horrible! If this is what they call ""fine dining"" then I will take a simply cheeseburger and fries any day. Their tomato basil soup was watery and gross, the challah roll was stale and hard, and  the albacore tuna from the albacore tuna salad tasted like it was canned. And don't even get me started about their pizza, I decided to be adventurous and try their BBQ Chicken Mango pizza. Remind me to never be adventurous again! The pizza was worst that I have ever tasted (and that is saying something!), the crust was undercooked, the chicken tasted rancid, and the pizza was cold! Don't even get me started on the service. I have never experienced such a rude, absurd, and disgusting service in my life! While my waitress was very nice and kept apologizing for my very long wait time, Samy was completely nasty. Has he ever heard of manners?! He was so dismissive of my family and I, and every time we went to complain about our meals he told us that we didn't know what we were talking about! How can we not know what we are talking about if we are the ones eating the food!!?! It was just ridiculous. I will never eat at ABC again, and I would like to warn others not to dine there either, but if you do and you have a great meal then; congratulations!"
2015-01-30,sS-89QKMFiNeO2lbjRd0pA,We had time before going to a movie so we stopped for dessert. All four desserts were amazing! I hope to stop for other offerings in the near future. The owner was very pleasant!
2015-02-19,sSM4AoWxVM9GlHVONIXd5g,"I love ABC. Honestly, the first time I went there was because I watched Kitchen Nightmares and I wanted to see if all the horrors on the show were true. THEY WEREN'T. The restaurant itself is beautiful and spotless with very classy decor. Sammy is one of the nicest, most courteous waiters I have ever had in my life, including at four star restaurants, and Amy is just as friendly and a kick ass cook. My boyfriend and I have been here at least four times and every time we go is phenomenal. We've had pasta which was perfectly cooked and presented beautifully, and we've had some of their newer dishes like the arugula salad and ham and cheese panini.  Amy's paninis melt in your mouth and have so much flavor, the outside has the perfect crunch and the inside is soft and melty.  I could eat them any day of the week. Don't even get me started on her desserts... One of the best creme Brulee I have ever had in my entire life and AMAZING chocolate tarts. I am a huge coffee snob, I won't touch the likes of Starbucks and I drink it black. Their coffee is out of this world, best I've ever had in Arizona. Bottom line... If you're going to write at bad review.... At least GO. Writing a bad review for a product you have never tried is not only cowardly; you're just a sheep, a lemming following others off the cliff and missing out on some awesome food. I WENT to ABC expecting it to be terrible. Boy was I wrong."
2013-08-16,sZ1uHB0uOIA0nJc93ViRZQ,"well the deserts are ok at best as for the main dishes I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. the owners are, well lets just say they remind me of a female dog and have no idea how to treat a customer. I will never go back and would recommend not ever going in the first place."
2013-08-28,sdP1yUb6EGlSStcTTBdp8A,"Amy's is a must stop for anyone looking for an entertaining bizarro culinary experience.Here's how it works:1.) start off with a fabulous dessert from the bakery as an appetizer2.) order the infamous undercooked fig pizza and drippy burger3.) wait 60-90 minutes for your meal4.) then when it arrives, send the food back to the kitchen for being uncooked and soggy5.) get berated and shamed excessively by the owners before getting kicked out6.) as they chase you out of the bakery, discreetly hand off a $10 bill to a helpless server like a drug deal transactionThere's something strangely appealing about this and if the owners knew what was best for their business they'd deliver the drama and theatrics for every customer.  While it's easy to find a half-decent burger, not many restaurants can provide a once-in-a-lifetime dining theme park rollerocaster ride."
2013-07-25,sgKNyCuL9LDBQrGa_PMa8w,"Was in Phoenix for business and tried this place on a whim. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. food undercooked, service flimsy at best, and owner made you feel like you were eating in a jail house. go elsewhere!"
2013-06-01,sk_UILnL8FTlIXK0c21VKg,"So, I went to Amy's with the lovely lady below (Katie R). We had fun! No, seriously, it was super fun! Everyone was crazy nice, even the other patrons, and the food was good! I also ordered the preserved lemon chicken panini (and I should have asked for her preserved lemons, it was so. good.). I personally wasn't a huge fan of the bread, but not enough so that I wouldn't order it again. I would. The desserts had me at glitter. OMGoodness, that's the way to my heart. It was huge, I ate it 4 separate times, and the butter! Oh, the buttery goodness. So, it's a super cute place, really yummy food (and I'm super hard to impress), crazy nice (but not crazy) people, and you should totally go."
2014-12-21,slxKimfFMP_NQMF2J78Nqw,"My wife and I have always enjoyed Amy's wonderful desserts and Sammy has always been attentive and nice.  However, we went there tonight and noticed they remade the menu with the most amazing appetizers and sandwiches.  The service was outstanding and we enjoyed the artichoke dip with bread (made with jalapeños peppers), panini sandwiches (bruchutto, brie cheese, and apple infused spread), and a beautiful egg salad (with truffle oil).  Our friend who was with us is a gourmet trained chef and had nothing but praise.  To top off the night, we tried their still amazing desserts (a vanilla bean pie with lemon topping and the flourless peanut butter chocolate cake with ganoch chocolate).  All of it for a very affordable price!  Everyone needs to stop watching and commenting about the show and actually experience the hard work Sammy and Amy have put into redoing the restaurant.  Amazing food, great service, and at new affordable prices.  People need to give these owners another chance and actually try the outstanding food.  WOW is all I have to say!  The deserts are still the best in town (by far)."
2014-11-02,spJ9Y5g1dvXYMfdyoA1m7A,This review is for the desserts only. Unfortunately when I arrived I was told the kitchen was closed so my sister and I chose to get some desserts to go. We bought apple & almond tarts they were so delicious! Even my picky grandparents loved them. My grandmother even requested my uncle to get some more for her! I'm sure we'll be back again.
2015-05-31,tBIaBNLnFdbzKkdEiyr-pA,The food i have to say was meh and really generic except for the desdert which i have to say was really damn good. But the reason I'm leaving a horrible review is because sammy flipped out on me when i complained about a undercooked 3 cheese pizza so i left really pissed off.
2014-09-02,tJAnH7SYlAgON0UUIO9Wog,"Enjoying life is doing the Creator's will.I went to this place while on vacation, and I think this place is amazing with class and style. The food, especially there cakes were amazing. I don't know why other people are writing different reviews most probably because local vendors are jealous of their success. I feel a strong connection with this place because it reminds me of Israel. My mother is from the Naharea in Israel and absolutely love their food back at home. I will absolutely come back to this place again!:) thank you for cooking such lovely food and being a blessing from God:)Thank you"
2012-06-29,tOOBQAQsGz34Thsqb6k3yw,"Nice family owned establishment with a pan-Mediterranean menu.  Had the fpuzza with fig, pear, prosciutto and Gorgonzola.  Tasty, although a bit heavy on the rosemary.  Very enthusiastic owner who takes care of the front of the house.  Don't be dissuaded by the strip mall location.  Misters on the patio."
2009-10-02,tRY6Y1sVehnJ2h3IsHcbnQ,"ABC Bistro is what happens when you take Amy's Baking Company and pair it with a charming Italian bistro. Formerly known solely for their baked goods, this space now has a full-length menu of primarily Italian fare mixed in with what I assume was previously on Amy's menu. We stopped in here on a whim (the packed PJ next door was where we were headed) after a movie. We saw balloons everywhere and ""Grand Opening"" written on the chalkboard out front so we decided to stop in. The service was excellent from the start. We told the host we would like to sit outside and she said, ""Great. I'll follow you to your table."" Very nice. The interior is interesting. Black chandeliers, black and white checkered tile, and string lights all over the place. A well-lit pastry case features enticing baked goods. The patio is cutesy and romantic with even more string lights and all manner of vines entwining the trellis. There's a real European flavor to the place, despite being inches away from the parking lot and the occasional whiff of popcorn from the theater across the way.  I had the pesto gnocchi. It was very good, but unfortunately the prices are a bit presumptuous. Almost every dish was over twelve dollars. At the same time, the wine list was less costly than I was expecting.ABC Bistro has an exceedingly warm staff and is a charming space given its location. I hope the business conglomeration does them all well!"
2014-01-12,tSi04ED3QY5cMhS4I_3j-w,"My family and I stopped there on our way home from Barrett-Jackson this afternoon to grab a little bite to eat. I'm Absolutely Amazed! The place was probably one of the cleanest restaurants that I have ever been in. I'm a stickler for cleanliness (18-yrs Army) and Sammy and Amy obvioulsy keep that place spotless; they would make any Drill Sergeant proud, jealous, and envious all in one - if thats even possible. The service was excellent, the prices were more than fair. Sammy was extremely professional and never told me to get the f**k out once.  Most Drill Sergeants would frown at his unusual kindness, they would call him weak and accuse him of being too nice to his customers. Yes, I have seen all of the hoopla on the internet, here (Yelp), and even the infamous 45-minute episode of edited snippets of money-making propaganda (Ramsey's version, mind you).  I did not get to meet Amy (sad face) nor did I hear her barking orders to or at anyone (this too would have given a Drill Sergeant the poopy-pants frown), but I know she was there because the food was unbelievably good (and I saw her on TV so I know she must be real). I really had no idea that it would be that good. Seriously, have people lost their ability to develop and conclude their ""own"" opinions through firsthand experiences, rather than that of second hand (if-even-that) information, that some TV show made (and edited) for ratings. Ratings equal money. But without further digression and like so many other ""open-minded"" people, I refuse to join or be a part of the couch-glued hate bandwagon without ever tried it out for myself, first hand. Glad we gave them a try, because they now have a new customer and new friends (without couch glue on our asses). We loved it. For the rest of the people out in the world that are going to believe everything you see on TV, or maybe what you have heard from someone who heard it from someone else who saw it on their Facebook wall, Twitter feed and/or read it on Snopes (so it must be true), you truly are missing out. Had we never heard about ABC or seen the show, we probably would have never eaten there today, let alone even discovering it. Thank you Sammy (and Amy) for your professional service and great food. We will be coming back very soon. Best, The Army guy and his family."
2010-04-18,tYIxOLwcZfnC5WrhtT0oUw,"Muk and I stopped in by here last night after a stuffing our selves with sushi at Sakana on Indian Bend.  Best sushi in town btw. We were looking for a nice dessert and the 4runner just drove to this place.  The place is well decorated with inside and outside seating and service, squeaky clean and welcoming.  They have a great and diverse selections of goodies in the glass case, many of them calling my name, French press coffee, tea and more.  I had a very generous piece of peach pie while Muk had the key lime pie.  Both were very very tasty.  I was a leetle bit startled that two piece of pie, a small press of decaf and a latte hit me up for 26 bucks or so, minus tip.  Ouch!  Nevertheless, that Amy is one bakin' fool!  I looked over the menu while downing the pie because something said I should go back and try some of their real food.  When i saw a nice sounding Monte Cristo on the menu, I knew going back to ABC is in the cards!"
2013-11-29,tcJzYkHGEQa1dpafXqbS3A,i went to az last month to visit my family and decided to give abc a shot  my suggestion is avoid at all cost. sammy the owner was yelling at a customer who said there food was cold and mine was no better i got the pizza which was undercooked and vinegary the deserts in the case looked good but after the outburst by sammy and his wife amy to follow we just wanted to leave but i still love az and allot of other great restaurants in the area and i would suspect that the kitchen nightmare episode was more real than people think because it mirrored my tragedy there and the other comment i don't believe are real the food was horrible the owners are mean bitter ppl i will never go there again this place deserves minus stars
2014-07-11,u1OnX8MDnx-qMqZK3wcFuQ,"I was sure the episode of Kitchen Nightmares was fake. Sadly it is not. Foid takes forever to come out, the owners can be heard yelling at the poor server. No idea how ths place is still open."
2014-10-23,uVCb1-isudpvH0QHRZfNPg,"We went to Amy's for lunch today. The food and service were excellent. We started with the veggie and olive tapenade and cream of carrot soup. The bread served with both were awesome. The carrot soup and tapenade were also fantastic. Our main dishes were both salads. Yummy! We will definitely be back. (We also took some deserts ""to go"" and will devour them after dinner!)Thank you, Sammy and Amy!"
2014-04-14,ufW5r52hKT3YZFcOTN1SIw,"Ok so I had to try it out, while in AZ on business I thought I would stop by. The food was not bad and I'm very picky. The owner has one of those faces (everybody wants to be the tough Italian guy look) The women peeked out know and then and she just seem to keep busy. I don't eat sweets but from what I can tell they looked great.Very clean prices ok food not bad actually it was good.Let these people be they are just running a small biz and have there normal everyday struggles.However I think it is absolutely irrational and un business like to keep any tips. And I hope that now that the wait staff is getting their tips they are sharing with the bus boy's as well as the dish washer.Once again Yelper's show a little mercy and grace on these people."
2014-05-18,uuvKE2VpAo8ZsiOQOf-wuA,"Came into town to see a friend and visited this place just to see if all of the rumors were true. I didn't see Amy, but I heard her. Sammy seemed nice. The food was absolutely horrible. Frozen, undercooked. But I was smart enough to not mention it to the owners. My opinion? Get fresh ingredients and take customers' opinions to heart. They only have your benefit in mind. Work on the cooking or just stick to baking."
2014-04-22,uz9CEDlLmKYboRPkY_Uy7A,The food sucks. Place smells like a garbage disposal. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.
2014-04-03,vAixUCs8KkJMVwFuISaNnw,"I have no idea what all of hoopla is about?? Our meatball pizza (lightly spicy, as recommended by a very kind and helpful Sammy) was delicious! The crust was crisp, meatballs flavorful, the cheese oh-so-gooey and the sauce was fantastic. The small is quite large in size...enough food that 2 of us were too full to enjoy one of their desserts. They looked incredible!!! We also met Amy, who was very gracious and welcoming. Give these guys a break on the bashing and try it for yourself!"
2014-01-19,vErdUPOHaeW0-7tgcZpebA,"I was in town and it was my birthday. It's not a birthday without cake and I remembered the dessert case from the show so I stopped in to grab a slice of cake to go. The decor was absolutely adorable and set a great ambiance! I wish I'd had time to stay and eat but I had to run with my slice of cake. Sami the owner was very nice and personal, although very busy. No one can say they don't work hard. I got my slice of chocolate dipped cheesecake and later devoured it in my hotel room. It was wonderful! The next time I'm in town I intend to stay for a meal and soak in the whole bistro experience. Sami said I'm welcome to come back anytime and I believe it."
2013-12-21,vMpvK8kfvn42KB0-oGmOlg,what can i say..such a dissapointment. I have never eaten raw dough before and this place serves it neatly in a plate. The ravoili was store bought and they claimed it was freshly made. I am never coming back to this place and especially since the owners feel they know best. That is not how to run a restaurant. Be respectful to your staff and customers. They are the backbone of your business.
2014-10-19,vSUu0PhBlC9MCpggqNlTkw,"We had wanted to come here for a while, after seeing the great looking desserts they offer. We passed on having dessert at the restaurant we had dinner at and came here. WE ARE SO GLAD WE DID!! The pastries were amazing! The caramel chocolate truffle was just to die for. The creme brulee was perfect, with a slight hint of lemon which was refreshing. And since it looked so good we also shared the flourless chocolate torte that was dense, rich and chocolatey. We couldn't stop eating it all.We were the only people in the restaurant, close to their closing time which made it quiet and cozy. The staff was friendly and the owner was extremely nice to us. We DEFINITELY will go back for dessert. It was way better than many top places in town. Thank you for a nice end to our night."
2013-09-19,vYQvnmP_KfaK64eDHPUz9Q,"I came here with my boyfriend around a month ago for our aniversary and thought about whether I should write the review or not... Don't like to give restaurants a bad review because, being a chef, I know it's a hard business.The old man in the cashier, which I assume is the owner, is really observant...in a creepy way. He watches you eat, watches you as you read the bill, continues to watch as you pay, asks you if you will leave any tip...etcIt just makes the entire experience of eating in a restaurant VERY awkward. There's also really loud music. However, the place looks great. It's really pretty and the desserts look unbelievable. Reminds me of high-end patisserie.I'm a burger person, so I ordered their burger with blue cheese. I don't quite understand what happens when you take a bite off that burger... The flavors work so wrong together. That truffle oil just kills everything else in the burger. The bun was very well toasted, so I gotta give them that. However, I literally had two bites and sent it back. Not good at all.My boyfriend had a cesar salad and it was... The lettuce was not crispy. It didn't taste like cesar salad, it just tasted like a bland aioli with no salt. Also, very greasy. Felt very tempted for their desserts and ordered the flourless chocolate cake. I'm gonna be honest here, it was fantastic. Now, just by looking at the menu, tasting the food, analizing the owner.. The desserts just didn't match. Maybe they have a different chef for their desserts? Who knows, could be!Overall I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody in the area. Its very pretty, but that's about it. The food is not well tought. There was screaming coming from the kitchen, which is very unprofessional. The owner is creepy...Hope this could help! And sorry for the bad review guys, hope you do better soon!"
2016-04-05,vbWL2NqQTJFCliqP1rXBTg,"I met Amy in a matter of minutes as I asked if I could try their pizza. She scoffed at me and said ""are you ordering it or asking about it."" I then said I would like to ask what type of crust is it and she asked me to leave. I apologized and she asked me to leave again! I looked and saw this guy coming to kick me out....that was it for me and my visit to this place. She then started yelling at me and saying I was a troll. I was mortified. How are these people still opened? I'm sorry to say I didn't even try the pizza. Pure chaos and she seems very unstable. Too bad."
2014-08-17,vpoDA1uZ6SDOJTA75Qs-eA,"I went to eat at ABC's last Saturday. The food was bland and the deserts were ""meh"". Idk what the big deal about this place is... It's just not good. The owners are just big ol' pansies..."
2014-09-05,vzwTXHLB5iTL2TlW6oVfUQ,"Wow Amy's was fantastic. We went there on Saturday for desserts. We were celebrating birthdays and selected the following desserts to share. Gluten free chocolate cake, lemon meringue, chocolate cake, gluten free coconut cake, and cheesecake. There were all absolutely delicious. It's hard to believe Amy makes all the desserts and is the chef. Sammy her husband served us and was gracious  and personable. Amy also came out to greet us. We didn't really know what to expect after seeing this restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares but it was way beyond our expectations.  We are looking forward to going back and enjoying a full meal next time. Highly recommend ."
2015-02-03,wHi7p98dio6xVc64RW2D3A,"On a recent visit to Phoenix, my foodie son begged for us to eat at Amy's.  Despite being aware of the bad press in the past, we were committed to giving the place a fair shot.  All I can say is thank goodness we ate there! The place is beautiful.  Sammy served us and was very attentive (admittedly we went at a quiet hour right before closing).  The four of us ordered a bunch of different dishes.  Everything tasted great from the soups, pastas, sandwiches.  The hummus and home made bread was especially out of this world delicious.  I am not usually a dessert lover but I must say that the chocolate peanut butter cake was probably the best dessert I have ever had.  We had a lovely conversation with Sammy who then introduced us to Amy upon my son's ""star struck"" request.  Amy was gracious and friendly and her kitchen is immaculate.  My younger son now follows Amy on twitter.  The couple could not have been nicer, the food couldn't have been better, and the restaurant couldn't have been more beautiful.  Too bad we didn't have enough time to go back again.  Shame on you Gordon Ramsay."
2013-02-24,wJtpUY-r0HWvrQFHuiuZ3A,"My 13 year old daughter and I stopped into Amy's for a quick bite before a movie. The place was almost empty. Me: (happily) Two for dinner please!Restaurant Owner: (with major attitude) Do you have a reservation?Me: NoR.O : Have you ever eaten at this restaurant before? Me: Yes, once.R.O: Then you know that you MUST have a reservation!Me: (looking around at over 20 empty tables, a little confused) OH, OK. (turning to leave)R.O: ( very reluctantly) Sigh...Well, I'll make an exception for you just this once. Me: Not if you are going to treat me like I'm doing you a huge favor by allowing us to eat at your restaurant. R.O. Well then by all means... (gestures toward door).I will never set foot in this restaurant again and will tell all of my friends to avoid it as well. The owner is RUDE and his superior attitude is totally unacceptable in the HOSPITALITY industry. We had a GREAT meal next door at Pita Jungle, which was packed. I had a grilled veggie salad with thahini...it was delicious. ABC would never stand a chance if they were not located next to a huge movie theatre. Their customers are obviously movie goers who did not have time to wait for a table at the healthy and friendly Pita Jungle. I'm telling Gordon Ramsey!"
2015-01-23,wLXNSbgQ7vsE4x-zI03NCQ,"We hadn't seen the show but while dining the owner Sammy mentioned it so we went there unprejudiced.  First of all, we met both owners and they were super nice.  We got our food in a timely manner and it was delicious.  We got a cheese panini and a turkey sandwich.  Yummmm.  Then a chocolate cake which was heavenly.  We will have to check out the show but as an unbiased reviewer we loved it!"
2013-07-06,wbM5R7rotzL_dbbWwPnhMw,"Holy hell what an experience.  My husband, two other couples and myself went to ABC for a drink and dessert after a dinner out to celebrate my birthday. What a horrible way to end a beautiful evening.  When we got there at 8:30, there were two other people in the restaurant, not including the owners, Sammy and Amy scowling at us as soon as we walked in.  Since we had already eaten, we decided to order meatballs and the jalapeno artichoke dip.  WOW what a disappointment.  The meatballs were dense and dry.  The dip tasted like a block of cream cheese was dumped in a bowl and jalapenos were placed on top.  the one saving grace was the bread they served with the dip.  It was perfectly crisp and flavorful.  Since there was an amazing display of desserts close to the entrance, we decided to split one for the table.  It was incredible!. Rich..delicious and amazing.  The problems really started once we received our bill...Six people, two appetizers and desert and 3 drinks and 3 extremely small Irish coffees..91 dollars!!! We questioned our waitress on why the irish coffees the men ordered were twelve dollars each, she immediately asked if we wanted to see the owner.  We said sure.  When I politely asked why the coffee was so expensive, I was asked by Sammy to tell him a fair  price.  When my husband did, he was told to get the f out. Amy, almost on cue, started recording us with her cell phone.  We said it was ridiculous but we would just pay and leave.  Sammy became immediately irate and told us to pay and get the f out.  My friend, who recently had a baby, had to go to the restroom before we left.  As I was standing outside the restroom door, Amy begins to scream at me "" why are you still here"" ""Get the F out you Fing c***""  I said did you seriously just call a customer that you have the balls to charge $90 to a C****.  I told her again that I thought half of the food was great but she only wanted to listen to the negative.  A woman came out of the kitchen and said ""please just go"" I said I would...once my friend was out of the restroom but I liked some of what we had and did not understand such a vicious attack on a customer. Amy  then called me a tramp and said she was calling the police. I said, well I don't understand how you can call a customer such names while you take their money.  Sammy continued to scream and tell us to get out and never come back.  My friend started recording it on his cell phone once Amy started recording us.  I have no idea what is wrong with these people. Save yourself the time and trouble and DO NOT GO HERE.   There was far more that went on and way too much to write (and quite disturbing and entertaining in a sad way), but really only worth going if you are looking for something quite different and unique and want to be belittled in some way, shape or form.  They truly seem like very bitter and angry people."
2014-11-04,wfZ6KIM0dtyOjPIOSFbWTA,"First, I want to say that I think the bad review people are just looking for their 15 minutes. Amy's was closing early for a political event and Sammy came to the door to let me know. I said that I was hoping to get a dessert & he said of course! He brought me in, packed up my dessert, and we chatted about politics. Sammy was very charming & respectful. It was a pleasant conversation over a touchy subject. Now to the food. I'm VERY high maintenance when it comes to desserts. If I'm going to indulge in that caloric intake, it better be worth it! I got the chocolate & peanut butter pie. All I have to say is WOW! As high maintenance I am with desserts in general, I am even more snobby when it comes to my favorite flavor combo of chocolate & peanut butter. This cake was hands down the best dessert I have ever had! It was a rich, creamy chocolate ganache with a ribbon of peanut butter inside. The balance was perfect! Don't buy into the negative hype. Try ABC Bistro. You won't be disappointed! You owe it to your tastebuds! Maybe try treating the owners with a tad bit of respect instead of like a TV sideshow and perhaps they won't be rude to you & you'll see the charm & witty owner that I saw."
2013-11-09,wlFp4sPNOFRifO58V5_N5w,"I recently went to eat here while eat on vacation. I heard about it on the news the day prior. I order a pizza and it took forever for it to arrive.The waiter which seemed like the only one there didn't check up on us in till the bill was ready.  The pizza was ok, but it was room temperature hot. I don't think I would ever eat here again if I go back on vacation next year."
2013-07-24,woIFHDytuex2UPOsib2pwA,"All our food was either under cooked or way over cooked. It's a pizza, how can you screw it up so horribly? Waist of money"
2012-11-18,wuYbmgHqquyjjG3X4BYOeA,ABC is fantastic every time. The food is consistently delicious and the owners treat us as though we are in their home. The patio is dog friendly and they always bring out something special for the little guy. The lemon garlic hummus and caprese salad are a must!
2013-06-02,wz3qQrI2tNaJAtvuRUIsyQ,Food is okay but the Owner is rude and pockets the tips. I heard this place was on the show kitchen nightmare and I can see why. If your looking for great food and a fun eating experience this is not the place.
2014-01-14,xPVBWySOvT_3a6hKqtML4Q,"That was television, this is reality.  I've watched the fated Kitchen Nightmares episode - thrice actually.  First out of curiosity, again from incredulity and once again - the night before visiting in person - to steel myself for what was to come.Oddly enough, the only negative aspects of the experience was a somewhat slow dinner, minor lapses in execution and most notably, a lack a show to go along with my dinner.I couldn't fault the service - Mr. Bouzaglo was the lone FOH and not only doted on his customers (only 9 covers... more on that later) adding personal anecdotes to every interaction as well as seriously busting his ass to take orders, make drinks, bus tables, and run food.Nor could I fault the food - a French onion soup ($10) starter was in the middle/upper echelons of French onion soups that I've tried, and served at an appropriately scalding temperature.  ""This is very very hot"", Samy noted with genuine concern.  Beyond that, the soup met all the savory, cheesy, salty, comforting expectations that one could wish for in a bowl of soup.I could only fault minor execution issues with my pizza - an andouille sausage, mushroom, caramelized onion and fried sage pie - and at $15 a very fair price for the quality/quantity of food delivered.  To nitpick, the pie was too sweet, owing to a heavy hand of caramelized onions and overcooked sauce.  And said pie took a good 10 - 15 mins longer than I thought necessary.  However Ms. Bouzaglo certainly knows her way around a pizza oven - I found the crust to be nicely charred with the right amount of chew and appropriate cornicione.There are certainly areas of improvement - on my visit, Mr. and Ms. Bouzaglo were the lone kitchen and FOH staff on hand.  Had the dining room been even half full, chaos would have ensued.  During my dinner, I overheard Mr. Bouzaglo lamenting / complaining that it was impossible to find qualified staff (really??).  Meanwhile, Mr. and Mr. Bouzaglo loudly disagreed (within customer earshot) on the lack of kitchen prep and pot washer staff among other topics.  Although the proprietors struggled to singlehandedly cook and service the nearly empty dining room, what customers were there seemed to genuinely be enjoying themselves.On television, the swagger remains.  In reality, Amy's Baking Company is a restaurant with promise, limited by delusion and common business sense."
2014-04-11,xW9Mob-6-VjziTgrn5jUFQ,"Update.....just fell back in love with Paul Simon's So Crazy After All These Years.  What a good song.  Here is my review that this update is for.  I ate there for their reopening.:There were three of us that ate there tonight and we did our version of a a tasting menu aka sharing our food. I had the portabella sandwich, my new friends order the pesto gnocchi with the house salad with the lemon dill dressing and the 18"" Margarita pizza. First my sandwich was was bland. The red peppers weren't roasted enough and the bottom bun was very soggy. I'll let that pass since I cut it into four portions for sharing. Winner was the Pita Jungle portabella sandwich which is what I had earlier in the evening. The gnocchi were swimming in the sauce. You could taste the pesto but it left a salty after taste the gnocchi texture was dead on however. The pizza was the worst thing. Toasty crust on one side and much lighter on the other. It was bland too and not to mention soggy in the middle.  We each had a slice and the rest went home with Apyrl.Here's the time table...seated at 8:32, signed the waivers as they were filming for their purposes, order taken at 8:42. Culinary Connie's salad arrived at 9:25 and the rest of the meal, one at a time at 9:40, 41 and we were asked if there was anything else and we told the food runner we were waiting on a pizza which was immediately brought out to us. Water was constantly refilled but it was warm (probably tap) from a plastic tupperware like container. The ice in my glass was melted and never re-added to my glass or the pitcher of water keep the water cool.I asked our server is she gets the tips and she said that everyone was asking that. I paid with my card and gave her cash. We asked for separate checks when we placed the order and was told it wouldn't be a problem. As on KN, Samy entered all the tickets and we received one bill at the end of the night. Samy seemed a bit flustered as our server tried to explain to him who had what. He came over and said to me what did you have? Mushroom. Okay around $17. Around? He did have it correct when the receipt came out. Apyrl was paying cash wanted a receipt so she could put it on her expense report as she was in town on business/seeing family. He ended up giving her the receipt for all three of us. She left $5 on the table and he made a point to tell the server that it was hers.The service was very good. Very attentive and always smiling."
2013-07-01,xi-XzXMqKC3Al7jHI3dNlw,"The moment you look at the menu is the moment you regret sitting down for dinner. Its a joke. The owner that greets you seems to be in a bad mood. He looks angry even when he's staring at the wall, which makes me think that male PMS may actually exist. The key to enjoying dinner at this place is eat prior to coming here. I give this place a 2 toes down because thumbs just don't do it justice."
2013-07-03,xoy8Zppyfr8dF4PVxX-8gw,"I came Arizona during vacation, and while I was there, I stopped by at ABC.Worst decision ever made.We came in on a Friday night, usually the busiest time for a restaurant, and there were probably 3 to 4 table there. We got taken to our seats, where a server greeted us. The service was very nice, but the wait wasn't. We ordered the meatball pizza and for a restaurant that had 3 tables there, we waited for nearly 40 minutes; way too long for a pizza. Then you would think 40 minutes would be enough time to cook a pizza properly, no, it comes out completely raw. I sent it back and they told me that they would make another one. That one wasn't much better either. This was a little more cooked, but still, raw. Even worse, aside from being raw, the pizza tasted terrible. The meatball was as dense as anything, and the cheese was oily and hard, and the whole thing just had a nasty after taste. By then, I decided to stop trying.So I asked for a bill. What's the worst part was they charged be double for sending the pizza back. Do not come to this place. Not only is their food nasty, but for the same money i spent, i could've bought 3 pizza's and Pizza Hut.  Go to any other restaurant, but here. I'm dead serious, this is the absolute worst restaurant I've been to. Just don't even think about coming here. Oh well, looking at the number of tables when i was there, it seems they won't be open for long."
2015-03-12,xqyTPRswy5q1nX6ZKMpRww,"Do not waste your time!  The service, as well as overall attitude from the owners, is irreparable. I would not have wasted my time if I would have known how the owners did not care about their customers and more about their ego!  Food is overpriced and not worth it."
2013-07-21,xxMZeqdKYqSYr7U9-w0jJw,"Just because I was in the area and I saw the show, worst experience and crap food."
2013-08-24,y3ILGywlWWSoNyE9CpJIyw,"Tried this place after the show. Of course yelp and Amy have deleted hundreds of reviews. Like the deleted, I agree the food is mediocre. Save your money."
2014-07-06,y4V9HJSfpy6qB2KoVaRrZA,"My husband and I went to ABC today to grab dessert. We were disappointed that they closed early since it was a slow day for them, but totally understandable since it's a family run business. Luckily, one of the owners opened up the door and said we were welcome to come in and get desert to go. My husband had a chocolate peanut butter cake and I had the lemon meringue. They were to die for!!! We cannot wait to go back to try more there, and the owners were really sweet to open back up for us!!"
2013-06-23,y6kUFqILtWgmB5rIXv-XzA,The owners kept giving me the stink eye every time I went up to the counter to complain about the long wait time for the food.  Definitely will not return.  Expected at least a tinge of hospitality.
2014-04-20,y94gLAqjV1laCocbRe7Z6Q,We went because of the publicity.  We had the white chocolate coconut cream pie.  It was delicious.  The service was fast and friendly.  We had a lovely experience.
2013-07-29,yDbgI-R0nkFJcqTSLm2T0g,"I never watched an episode of Restaurant Nightmares until my friends told me about the episode featuring Amy's Baking Co., and I was instantly intrigued. As soon as I was in town, we made our way there to check it out. The restaurant itself is nice and clean, decorations are nice and everything on the interior looks great. We went on a Saturday at 7 pm and wasn't very busy (there was another table doing dinner, and one doing desserts). The service was good, although a bit excessive. It was almost like they were anticipating that we wouldn't enjoy the experience, so they overcompensate and all our interactions had a sort of sense of uneasiness. Samy was very friendly and nice to us. We didn't interact with Amy, but another table asked to take a picture with her, and she seemed happy to come out of the kitchen to do it. Our server asked us what our nationality was. We're US citizens....it was a somewhat awkward question to ask, and she just wanted to find out if we were Chinese so she could show off her saying ""I love you"" in Mandarin...We ordered the meatballs, the caprese salad, flatbread, and 2 pizzas. Everything was generally up to standard. The pizzas are thin crust, and were crispy. I really enjoyed the Fig & Prosciutto Pizza, it was amazing. We also had the asparagus pizza, which was good, but was a little bit salty for my taste. The flatbread is pretty much a pizza crust with some seasonings and herbs.For dessert,  we ordered chocolate mousse and something else, it was like a chocolate pie with toffee and edible glitter on top. They were really delicious and rich. The food and the restaurant are fine, but I think the price point is a little high for the food."
2013-06-04,yFCKe_IXlg62l7AdVs6rwA,We were travelling from Canada and visiting friends in Arizona. Our friends suggested that we try this restaurant and that it was on Kitchen Nightmares. They were too scared to try this place on their own.The Caesar Salad was good although there was too much egg in it. The Eggplant Parmesan was horrible. My seventeen year-old sister does a better job. The atmosphere was dull and the food took forever to come. My husband had the Margherita Pizza and was disappointed. The dough was raw and just tasted floury. He did not want to send it back as he was worried that the chef would do something in retaliation. The staff was super friendly and always checked up on us. We didn't even bother to stay for desert as we didn't feel comfortable there.We will never return
2014-05-12,yFKUJ4qxYp--MebD9vRc_A,"Well I stopped here after visiting a friend in Mesa and I was hardly impressed.  The taste of the desserts was nothing you could not find in the frozen section of a grocery story or at Whole Foods:  either overly sweet or underbaked/cooked.  It looks nice on the inside but I guess if you spend all of your money on decorations and not on buying quality ingredients or frozen foods from vendors, what do you expect.  The funny thing is all of the photos I found on their Facebook page look nothing like the desserts in the cases.  I even asked a waitress, who seemed terrified and wary of every word she said, wasn't even sure how the desserts tasted since she didn't eat sweets.  What kind of example does that make for a bakery to hire people that don't eat sweets or baked goods???  Are the owners that desperate for help that they prefer to hire warm bodies instead of advocates of their trade???  So I did a Google search about the place and found out that a lot of the photos ARE NOT FROM AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.  The photos they use in their Facebook page and on their website are stolen from other online bakeries/businesses.  Well that explains the disconnect of the desserts and the staff.Other than what I have posted and researched, this place is to be avoided.  I would imagine they're months if not weeks away from closing down since because of the bad food, bad publicity and bad energy I felt after leaving this dump."
2015-07-04,yPVUOv56zrYlpP7wJpJJWg,"While in town, we could help but pop into this place because it was on Kitchen Nightmares! It was quite the experience!Ambience: The decorations were very classic which made this restaurant charming! I also liked the cat paraphernalia , since I am a huge cat person! Best of all, the dining area was immaculately clean!Sammy: He was very friendly and accommodating. He was the one who waited on us. We admitted to coming here because of the show which he was open to all of our questions and curiosities! The important thing was that we had great customer service! Amy: She wasn't quite as friendly as Sammy was. If I ran the whole kitchen I don't know how friendly I would be either because I would be exhausted too! She's a talented baker though. Her pastries both tasted and looked great!Menu: Their menu is now different from what you see on yelp and the show! Their menu features mainly salads, soups, and sandwiches! I didn't get to taste anything from it because we had just come back from  a BBQ. I was disappointed to see that  their burgers, pizzas, and pasta were gone because they looked so good!Coffee and desserts: My fiancé and I ordered a French press coffee and a lemon cake.  The coffee was great, not watered down like in most places! They also brought a side of steamed milk without an extra charge, awesome! The lemon cake was great, it had multilayers and marzipan flavor to it. My fiancé who doesn't like sweets other than chocolate helped me finish that piece! Verdict: Next time I'm in town I'll definitely return, and I would want to try their sandwiches! I'll be sure to order their coffee again and another dessert! To those of you who have watched Kitchen Nightmares, go in with an unbiased open mind!"
2017-05-09,yQs__gsoXhQiyVez5p-9YQ,The owner (Sammy?) told me to F off 10 minutes into my visit.But the decor was nice - would recommend.*not a real review - inspired from watching Gordon Ramsay YouTube videos.
2013-06-06,yTZPv-dVhUV68zR79cxLhA,"I was here with my girlfriend earlier in the year after watching our hometown team LA Lakers vs Phoenix Suns, since we were in the mood for some European Bistro.I ordered the pulled pork pizza, and she ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and 3 meatballs. The spaghetti were crunchy, meaning undercooked. The meat sauce was very watery and smelled funny. The meatballs were definitely tasted frozen, and not freshly made. The pizza was also undercooked, very much like raw dough. The pork tasted also like frozen, and the BBQ sauce made it too sweet, like a dessert item. Apples on it did not help. Who puts apples on a pizza?When we tried to tell the owners nicely, they yelled at us, and said we don't know food. I don't think so. I have a BS and MS in Food Science from Cal Poly Pomona. My gf has a BS in Hotel Restaurant Management, also from the same school, where we met. Therefore, I know how food should be cooked, and what it should taste like. She knows how a restaurant should be properly run. What we both saw, was not right.If you want pizza & spaghetti in a restaurant style setting, instead of fast food delivery, then go to California Pizza Kitchen, BJ's Brewhouse, or Numero Uno Pizza, but not here..."
2013-07-30,yh0L-ODH612WN-QsahdS9Q,"Came here while on vacation. I saw the restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares and wanted to check it out. We just ordered a plain cheese pizza and salad. I'm from Chicago and we know pizza. We got our pizza and the dough/crust was still raw and soggy in a lot of areas. How do,you mess up a simple cheese pizza? We left the pizza ate our salads and left. This place is simply open because it's on it's 14th minute of fame. There are many great Italian restaurants in the area Yelpers. Check em out instead!"
2013-06-19,yr42_FZkszoM8nwN6KjU7A,"Okay so I'll be honest, I saw the Kitchen Nightmares episode and I only went because a train wreck that close to home was too tempting to pass up. The inside of the restaurant is nice although there is a line of mirrors and sconces on the back wall that are hung crooked and that was a little distracting for my OCD. The volume on the music is up too loud to have any sort of conversation without yelling across the table and around 8pm they dim the lights so low I had a hard time seeing anything at all. The servers are friendly, they say they are now receiving their tips although there is no telling how true that is so I suggest giving them cash separate from however you decide to pay your bill.As soon as we walked in we were asked whether we wanted dinner or dessert, if you aren't sure you'd better get sure quickly because they don't give you time to make a decision. We opted for dinner (won't make that mistake again). The list of appetizers is a joke, your options are a bowl of salted olives, eight different kinds of hummus - you have to order the bread separately - or artichoke/jalapeno dip (the dip comes with what they call pita bread but is really pizza dough). We ordered our entrees and appetizer at the same time, the artichoke/jalapeno dip since it was the only one that comes with bread and for the entrees, the ham and brie panini and the lemon chicken panini. 45 minutes later we got our appetizer, none of the flavors go together (unless maybe you're stoned out of your mind and all you had to eat was pizza crust, artichoke hearts, olive oil and jalapeno paste then I guess it could be considered a creative take on gnosh-worthy food), wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten but I wouldn't want to eat it again ever. Another 45 minutes later our sandwiches made their way out.... it takes a special lack of talent to mess up a sandwich. The lemon chicken was more than ""EEW"" worthy. The ham & brie was about as bland as cardboard but a lot more greasy.   I cannot say enough about how gross the bread was, supposedly they make it there but truly I don't care where they make it, it still tastes awful.  Overall, service is slow but at least the servers are friendly. The food is over priced, not good and I don't think anything in that restaurant is any more homemade than anything  I could find at Subway. It was good for a novelty night out but I will never go back."
2015-10-20,yrLGAp_oRNeXsltdTkivbw,"Absolutely horrible food and service, basically just as shown in Kitchen Nightmares. Incredibly rude. Very happy to hear this place is closed/closing."
2013-08-29,yvzii731ZptWxyNQeajtFQ,"The pizza I had was very good, it was covered in rosemary and had so many strong complimentary flavors. I'm not much of a desert fan but I tried my partner's pastry... it was good but very sweet. I probably won't return as there are so many restaurants to try in the Phoenix metro."
2013-05-23,z7e03JUaJIMhcsBZbZdZqQ,"I went here about a year ago, the food was not that bad. Honestly I think these people are a little shady, but the place was not run down and the salads were super yummy. I feel like it's easy to troll on them on the internet. So I just wanted to leave an honest review. BUT I don't think it's right for them to take the tips that we leave behind for the waiters/waitresses."
2014-09-05,zb9f61sAan0X1oVxxtyetg,"If I could give this place negative stars I would.  The food was just ok but the business is just not ethical.  If you have any problems with the food, beware of saying anything because you will be put in your place and intimidated."
2011-04-06,zkR8V9YFtjKhMzZCsB6RIQ,We just were at Amy's on Sunday for the 1st time. I can't believe we haven't found this great little gem before.The food was fabulous!!! The olive tepanade and flat bread was fantastic! The caramelized pear salad can't be beat. The owner was delightful and made our dining experience wonderful. Everything we ordered was great and the service was excellent. I went back on tues to get carryout for a gathering at our home. We are  recommending this restaurant to all our family and friends & we look forward to our next dinner there!!
2013-08-11,znQaC_TBRBMKTGdQQ0Rwvw,"I was visiting family there and I just had to go see if it was really that bad. I was surprised!  it was. I ordered like Ramsay.  I had the blue ribbon burger and my sister got the fig pear pizza monstrosity, we split them both, the pizza was almost in inedible, we both had about one slice worth and pushed it aside. It was just so under cooked, it was flopping around. and the taste was nasty.  I like interesting combinations but that doesn't mean any combinations. the burger.... the burger was a mess.  It didn't taste as bad at the pizza and it was at least cooked all the way through but the mix of flavors was just, off.  like I can't put it but, it wasn't right. and obviously as you've heard, it was a soggy mess. its one of the few times that I ate almost nothing and didn't take it home. Way overpriced too.As far as the owners go, I never saw Amy and the other guy was basically gruff but not really rude.  it just seemed like he was watching me a little too hard. I think I heard them bicker in the back once, but nothing too bad. the other staff though was really polite and made it a little better. Its just the food!! ugh.  maybe had I been brave enough to send something back, I would have gotten to see more of their famous personality :)I love trying new places, but I don't write reviews very often, unless they are awful and I want to warn people.  or if I am surprised. Sorry if the grammar sucks"
2013-09-15,m35ODBrr76JYr20nxoMg_w,Stopped in for desserts and coffee. Spent some time talking to the owner Sammy. Seemed like a very nice guy and we chatted for a good 15 mins.He went on to tell me about the drama he had with Gordon Ramsey etc which def seemed to take a toll on his business for better and worse.The French press coffee was excellent and the cakes were fantastic.Good spot. We will def stop back in for dinner sometime.
2013-07-02,EiOpKhajB06Z-GF4iyquUw,"I only swung by here after I got some ""recommendations"" from the locals after my trip to the Sonoran Preserve (really nice hiking area). I only came here for a light meal, but it ended to be not the best experience. First, I'm surprise with the mix of strong and negative reviews; maybe the restaurant just had a re-regrand opening, but I'm not the judge. So, here are my thoughts:I had a light drink with their glazed seared salmon salad and some garlic-y flatbread appetizers. I like the fact that they were trying to go organic and include fresh options. However, I wish the salmon was not overcooked, and the honey citrus glaze had a funky after-taste I'm not sure what is up with that.Their desserts did look appetizing, but I did not have room for that. Conclusions: I'm not a big fan of their food, there was an uncomfortable confrontation at the front house, very odd and unsettling environment yet I do like the décor and a ""try"" for fresh ingredients towards their Italian-style dishes, but I was expecting more of a baking restaurant than anything. It's an alright place; I think."
2013-05-22,c9zDQl4vQg41Pxmc5TpWWQ,"Ate here last year with work colleagues. We did not find the food good at all. We gave it a star because Yelp will not let us give the place zero.Fiasco with KN apparently happened. We do not care bout it! What we do care bout is the quality of food, and service we received.Here is an update:Was excited to learn of it's grand re-opening. Ate there last nite. The service was inconsistent. The food was still sub par.Sorry. I, and my colleagues, will not be returning at this establishment again."
2014-10-12,Tyb_FnUv3L0LqsYyL8FIAQ,"I was disappointed to see that they've changed their menu from pastas/pizzas to sandwiches/salads. Apparently, they're trying serve healthier, easier-to-make foods.My boyfriend and I got the cheese panini and caramel cheesecake. The panini tasted like any other you could make at home and the salad was drenched in its dressing.The cheesecake was good ONLY if you had the caramel drizzle and crust in the same bite. Otherwise, the middle of the cheesecake itself was bland. Samy and the waitress who served us were really friendly and at the end of our meal, Samy came by to thank us and shake our hands."
2015-07-07,-mSpi4ZHr62tcQPo1GdBkA,"All right, I'll be honest. I went because I was in town on business, and had seen the train wreck that was Kitchen Nightmares. I was morbidly curious.I arrived with a coworker around 7:00 on a Thursday. We were the only ones there. There was Sammy and Amy, and one woman cleaning, and us. That was it. We were served by Sammy himself, which was nice. My coworker and I both ordered the pasta and drinks. Mine was phenomenal. It was the regular spaghetti with red sauce, and I loved every bite. They have revamped the menu since the show, so there wasn't any undercooked pizza. (Not gonna lie - I was going to order some if they had it. I guess it's a good thing they took it off the menu.)Once we were finished, we ordered dessert. Oh my god. If any of her desserts would have made the trip to Louisiana well, I would have bought several to take home. I ordered this lemon creme brûlée cheesecake thing and it was so good. I was shocked. Although Ramsay did say that her baked goods were amazing!Overall, the price was all right. If you don't mind dining alone - and you're in the mood some killer dessert - please check out ABC. It's a shame Amy's crazy antics scared most of the customers off; their renewed service and menu was amazing. The"
2014-04-20,AsUDg2wZZqkgZzl0kuFvIA,"Dinner for 1.- PrefaceI went to Amy's Baking Company with an open mind. After all, reality TV does have a tendency to make things appear more extreme. However, I was nervous. What if Samy smelled a Yelper?  There were many things I was afraid to order. Damn you Kitchen Nightmares. While the menu is filled with gnocchi choices, I deviated since I didn't want to eat non-refrigerated, packaged gnocchi. The burger was out since it looked like a greasy mess. And I didn't like the idea of eating raw dough, so no pizza. They were out of soup that night, which I found mildly annoying. In order to write an objective review, it was important to me to remain a neutral, regular customer, with no unnecessary provoking. - Ambiance (4/5)ABC is clean and chic, but quite empty inside. I was 1 of 3 tables. Perhaps it would have been excusable, except the place next door was quite busy.- Service (3/5)Samy did most of the work with the only waitress in the restaurant unmotivated; Samy even had to ask her to refill my water. If Samy took the tip, I wouldn't have faulted him. He was professional all night, bordering friendly dare I say? Service was also fast. I did catch a glimpse of Amy, who had an iPhone earphone on--either listening to music or on the phone in the kitchen.  She seemed quite calm and collected. Every time Samy came to the table with food, he would tell me how delicious it would be. Also, instead of asking how the food was, he would ask ""it's delicious, isn't it?"" So even when I had some serious concerns, I just let it pass. I'm not really a confrontational person. Just come home and Yelp about it!  - Bread (N/A)Considering the upscale vibe ABC is going for, I was quite surprised not to receive any bread.- Lemon Garlic Hummus, $5 (2/5)The lemon garlic hummus had good Mediterranean flavor, but I think Amy must have added a ""drizzle"" of oil on top, because it was too oily. Of the bits I was able to taste, it was actually decent, but the oiliness really put me off and deterred me from finishing.- Herbed Flatbread, $5 (5/5)I felt deceived. I ordered the hummus expecting there would be some sort of bread or cracker included. So, when Samy asked casually about the flatbread with the hummus, I assumed it was included. It wasn't. The flat bread comes in a huge portion, about 10 big pieces. Quite good!  Garlicky, toasty on the top, but soft in the middle. I'd certainly come back for the flatbread. Ironically, the one thing I didn't intend to order turned out to be the best.- Pesto Spinach Ravioli, $16 (2/5)Gordon Ramsey dissed the ravioli on the show, but he seemed to make more a hubbub about the fact that they were frozen. I highly suspect these were the same frozen raviolis that Gordon got since fresh raviolis have a different texture. These raviolis were also quite flavorless, which is ironic considering the really salty and oily (sensing a theme?) sauce they were drenched in. I was ""foraging"" for raviolis. The spinach was cooked quite nicely, and I do appreciate the fresh tasting prosciutto and mushrooms. The concept was nice. If the sauce was a bit less oily, Amy used a little bit less salt, and we had homemade raviolis, this would've been a passable dish.    - Key Lime Pie, $10 (1/5)ABC had been criticized due to revelations that the desserts were store bought and not actually homemade. Who cares? I'm sure this kind of thing happens far more than we know. To my severe disappointment, it was not at all good. It had a bit more of an oily foamy consistency. It was also much more sour than key lime pie should be, and the crust tasted a bit burnt. And what's with the edible glitter! I think this pie is the perfect representation of ABC--glittery on the outside, but once you dip your fork in past the surface, you find some unappetizing elements.  - Value (2/5)Considering the prices ABC is charging, I expected a fine dining experience. Unfortunately, the food is just not up to par. Even if the key lime pie had tasted good, $10 for a piece of pie? C'mon... it's only $8 at Joe's Stone Crab in Miami!! The portions are large--Samy mentioned that everything they do is large. And while quantity might be important to some, quality is more important to me.  - Final WordI'm disappointed that Samy and Amy did not take Gordon Ramsey's advice. With instruction, Chef Amy could serve good dishes. I would love to see the owners take a chill pill and fix things. If I hadn't seen the way they treated customers on the show, I would have felt sorrier for them.  They looked quite rundown by all the attention. To the reviewers who keep leaving 1 star reviews without having visited the place, stop. Go try it; then let your Yelp review do the talking. The other 2 tables there looked like regulars, and they seemed to like the food. Not sure if they've lost their taste buds, but to each his own. To the owners--swallow your pride and figure it out!  I hope I can come back one day when your food is better.  Good luck."
2013-06-03,1fPiKjZhkGWLya1QLkwlhQ,"This moment was bound to happen.  I knew nothing of this place prior to the internet exploding last month after ""the episode"" aired.  I didn't want to go right away, and I felt it was my duty to go with an open mind.  The anticipation slowly built like the 1st time I was a wingman in a no-win situation - or the 1st time I tried fried ants in Brazil... but I digress.We arrived to a semi-busy dining area, and were immediately greated by Samy.  After sitting down and placing drink orders, I noticed that there was only one waitress for all the tables, with a swarm of young drones refilling drinks and running food to and fro.  Occasionally I would hear the bell ring and giggle to myself.  Thrice I saw Amy appear, only to peer at the crowd whilst mean mugging, and multiple times I saw Samy yell orders / nudge employees / dictate demands to the poor drones.  This got progressively worse as more and more people arrived, ultimately filling the inside of the restaurant.The waitress did the best she could, even at full capacity it appeared as if she was the only one taking orders, and so from a service perspective, I can't fault the employees - they did the best they could.  We weren't starving, but wanted to try an appetizer - which surprisingly was quite tasty.  We got the artichoke / jalapeno dip with flatbread.  The flatbread was fully cooked, had a good flavor, and although the dip was cold, it was a nice compliment.  We also ordered a couple of their desserts, the key lime pie and the flourless chocolate.  The crust of the key lime was overcooked, but outside of that the only comment I have about the desserts is that if you're going to charge ten bucks per item, you should probably let people know so that they're not surprised when they get the bill.All of the people around us seemed to enjoy their food, and the presentation for most of it really looked nice.  We all know that the food, while maybe the most important element, isn't the only one when deciding where to spend our hard earned money.  So, in my opinion, the food isn't the problem here.  When a dining experience becomes stressful, it's just not worth it.  We DID tip the waitress, but did so outside of the bill to ensure the owners didn't get their greedy paws on it.I am not a hater, I am not a cyber-bully - but I call it like I see it - and my opinion is you just can't fix crazy.  Meow."
2012-11-14,JPEp9OrW0HLZUQ4t-ODM6w,"Best hummus /flat bread combo in town.  It's simply perfect, just like the french press coffee.  Such well done classics are accented with imaginative pastries and pizza toppings.  We've learned from talking up one half of the ABC team, Sammy, while his wife Amy is hard at work in the kitchen, that most everything is made in house.  Including the fig jam and red pepper marmalade that have become an unexpected pizza topping obsession for my girlfriend and I.  Even though i was scared of the mango bbq chicken pizza, she talked me into it, and I didn't regret it. Passionate, imaginative flavors and service, we want to go back every week."
2013-10-16,QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,"I finally had the opportunity to try this place out for myself.  I don't trust reality TV shows and watching the episode featuring this place just made me want to give it a try so I could see what all the hoopla was about.  I walked in with an open mind.When I arrived, Sammy and Amy were in the restaurant behind the counter.  They greeted me when I entered and said hello back.  I asked if I could sit where I wanted to and Sammy said sure.  The weather was awesome, so I dined outside on the patio.  After browsing the menu, I decided to order:Creamy Artichoke & Jalapeño Dip, $5Herbed Flatbread, $518"" Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza, $22Chocolate TruffleThe appetizers are a la care, so I had to order the Flatbread and the Dip....It was a lot of food...easily enough for 3 to 4 people to split.  The Flatbread was really good and the Creamy Artichoke & Jalapeño Dip was like a Cream Cheese spread....delicious and full of flavor.The Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza came out and I was pleasantly surprised to see fresh Mozzarella used.  The Pizza is a thin crust style and was tasty.  It's not the best Pizza I've ever had, but it was very good.  I purposely ordered too much so I could take some home.  The 18"" portion size is enough for 3 or 4 people.I saved some room for dessert.  I went inside to look at the dessert options.  After looking around, I decided to order the Chocolate Truffle...man, this was really good!  It is very rich and sweet....melted in my mouth and was a nice way to end a good meal.Overall, the service was good.  Sammy was very pleasant.  He made a couple of jokes and was on top of our meal.This experience just goes to show that you can't believe everything you see on TV.  I'm glad I came and tried it for myself.  There's a large selection of Gnocchi on the menu that I will definitely come back for.Return Factor - 90%"
2013-06-03,apeOl8XYQqnvoee7S2pHlQ,"I went in with a completely open mind. Hoping that all this media hype was false. Let me start by saying the staff (waitress & other staff) were really personable and very attentive. Our drinks were constantly being re-filled and they checked back with the table at regular intervals to make sure we had everything we needed. I was a little apprehensive to try a full meal as the prices were a little expensive. I cannot speak to the quality of the entree's. We did however try an appetizer and two desserts.  Appetizer - Artichoke jalapeño cream cheese with herb flat bread:The flat bread was crispy and flavorful, the dip was served cold (I think it was supposed to be cold but it didn't say that on the menu.) The jalapeño's where in a bunch on the side of the dip and required mixing. The combo of the bread and the dip was decent, it didn't knock my socks off but it had okay flavor. Desserts - Key Lime pie & Chocolate Mousse torte: The key lime filling tasted good, the crumb crust was slightly burnt. The crust ruined the pie for me. The chocolate mousse torte (I think that is what it was called) was not bad at all. It was a little overpriced at $10 but  it was the best thing we ate that evening.We didn't see any craziness from the owners while we ate and the place was pretty busy. In summary, the food wasn't great, but not horrible either. The prices were a little on the expensive side so be prepared for that if you go for the full meal deal. FYI: To folks w/small children: We had no trouble coming in with a stroller  but when we went to leave we were ushered out the back door. They cannot accommodate a stroller going between the tables when the restaurant is crowded."
2014-08-14,0GCu2I0Qqut5axQSWTWnAg,Nasty food and terrible service!! The owner is nuts and I am glad I did not pay for any of that crap. There was a piece of hair in my pizza and the desserts looked store bought. We got our food and once we saw how bad it was we left. We ended up going to mcdonalds for dinner..
2014-06-10,0sl4I8R7znWXp_K4A0nZ_w,"This is an update from my previous visit on 9/30/13. I went back to the restaurant on 6/5/2014 while on business yet with my niece's husband that was a local in Phoenix. Like the first time, I went to lunch and had the bleu ribbon burger on my mind.After arriving, Sammy greeted me almost immediately and remembered me from last year. I noted to him that I was in town for lunch and had hoped to try the bleu ribbon burger, to which he noted that he had changed the menu and had taken the bleu ribbon burger off of the menu. He recommended a pizza for myself and niece's husband to share, to which I accepted.The pizza was quite good! Not too heavy, not too light and definitely not greasy at all. It was a standard pepperoni and sausage pizza that was cut into eight pieces. The presentation of the pizza as well as the flavor really lightened the mood as well fulfilled my appetite. Along with unsweetened iced tea, this made for a good lunch.An additional server asked if we would like desserts. Although I absolutely never order desserts (especially on lunch) due to the sugar content, I made an exception this time out. Its just hard to say no when you have at least three dozen selections of cakes encased in the glass cabinet directly over my shoulder from where we were sitting in the restaurant. I ordered a delectable chocolate mousse cake (not the one with peanut butter), which was served with whipped cream and green mint garnish on the side as well as with two small berries. As expected, the dessert was phenomenal! So good, in fact, that I couldn't finish all of it due to how rich it was with the chocolate. Well worth the $$$ for dessert. Among the best that I've ever tasted.I was finally able to meet Amy this time, who came out of the kitchen to greet the two of us as well as give thanks for our business. Sammy was incredible, as expected. Very candid and likable, Sammy took the time to converse with us both about the food selections as well as the show that was featured with Gordon Ramsey. He recommended for us to view the follow up show, of which I noted that I would.All and all, I felt very comfortable in this establishment. The food is absolutely exceptional both in its presentation as well as quality. I've had two very good experiences here for lunch, and my niece's husband even commented that he enjoyed the food + the venue. On both occasions, I arrived here with an open mind without bias (from the show) and was not disappointed. Even more so, it is refreshing to be around down to Earth proprietors such as Sammy & Amy Bouzaglo. Great conversation, and Sammy even posed for pictures with me, which I thought was pretty cool. 5-stars."
2015-02-24,KTK_ws8lu_TWfR7DtDWjMA,"Although this may be the most infamous restaurant in the Valley, our experience could not have been better. The owners, Samy and Amy, were extremely nice and it was great to meet them. My only concern is that because they are now doing everything themselves, they are going to burn out very quickly. For dinner we started with Amy's famous flatbread and the artichoke dip which is so filling and delicious it could be a meal in itself. We followed that up with panini sandwiches. I had the provolone and muenster with prosciutto and Lauren had the spicy salami with peppers. Both of our sandwiches were excellent, although as good as the flatbread was, I wish they still served pizzas :-)Finally, we finished off our meal by splitting a flourless chocolate cake (I don't recall the official name) that was the perfect mix of decadent flavors and moist chocolate cake. If you're planning on eating dinner, I highly recommend making reservations because now that Amy, Samy, and one dishwasher / busser make up the entirety of the staff they are having to turn away potential customers once they reach a certain number of customers in the restaurant. While some walk-up customers may not like this, it certainly means that the quality of service is ensured for the customers who are already seated.However, if you just want to stop in for dessert, you can easily do that without a reservation and you will still have a great time.The night we dined, there was a good crowd and many appeared to be regulars. We will definitely be returning and its a good reminder that there is generally nothing real about ""reality TV"".The moral of the story, don't let your preconceptions stop you from trying this place or you'll miss out on an excellent meal!"
2013-07-24,bNcNllWgvacXzjBIVEf3Nw,"Me and a couple friends decided we wanted to try out Amy's Baking Company. We're from out of state and ate out nearly every meal and Amy's was (by far) the greatest meal we had. The customer service, the food, the atmosphere was outstanding. Even better than the entree was the dessert. I had the best creme brûlée I have ever had in my life. I can't wait to return here next time I'm in Scottsdale."
2015-08-20,4bI4Iy6UCt9pWgOtaewbIw,"I see that Yelp is reporting that Amy's is closed.  I have no idea if that is true or not because I am like 3 weeks late on writing my review.  The website still seems to be working so I am just going to assume that they are still open and write my review anyway.  As I said, my visit was about 3 weeks ago.  Yes, I admit I totally came because of all the craziness and controversy surrounding this place and I wanted to check it out and see what was what.  The visit was interesting.  The shopping center was busy and it was hard to find a spot but we did and were surprised to find that Amy's was mostly empty.  Sammy was behind the counter and said something about how they were about to close but they would help us anyway.  I asked about the different cakes and desserts behind the counter and he wasn't sure so he called Amy over to help us.  I was pretty excited.  Amy was very nice and explained each of the different items.  We chose two different pieces of cake and took them to go.  The restaurant is kinda nice but also weird due to all of the cat stuff everywhere.  The cakes were both really good but for $10 a slice it was a little much.  I can get a crazy huge and yummy cake at Costco for $20."
2014-02-18,5TCgTJE7uZ848zOEEUiVNg,"I refuse to judge a place before I try it and you should too!Like many of you, I watched the season finale of Kitchen Nightmares.  Working in a family business myself and knowing it is never easy, I wondered if owners Amy and Samy could possibly be like they were portrayed on the show or if there was some fancy editing done on the show.  Knowing that reality TV is usually far from reality, off we went last Saturday night for dinner at Amy's Baking Company.I called the Monday before our planned dinner and made reservations for four.  I spoke with Samy and he kindly took my reservation even though he told me we didn't need to make one.  Plans changed and by Saturday night our group had grown to seven but I was reluctant to call and advise them of the change.  I was a little nervous....would they be mad?  Would Samy yell at me?  Silly questions, I know but legitimate ones after watching the show.   He really is a nice guy and I was silly to think otherwise.  My husband and I walked in to the restaurant and informed Samy we had a group or seven total coming and he was more than accommodating.   He set us up for seven and we were seated.   Samy asked if we wanted appetizers so we ordered the herbed flat bread, The bread was soft, flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  Samy had advised us because our party was so big that the food might take a little longer because Amy was preparing everything fresh.  I can tell you that the food service was fast.  We had our appetizers in under 10 minutes.We next ordered our entrees.  Our food came to us in about 15 minutes or so.  Amy made every item we ordered herself and let me tell you, she can cook!   I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Penne Pasta.  The chicken breast was large and nicely breaded.  The marinara was perfect, not too tangy and not too sweet.  Underneath the layer of cheese were nice large basil leaves.  This really added nicely to the flavor.  The penne was fabulous as well, buttered and spiced nicely. My husband ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken and boy was it good.  Very creamy and delicious and a nice sized portion, enough to eat some and take home.  I'm having the leftovers for lunch today and can't wait!  Amy was nice enough to advise us on how to reheat it so that it was just as tasty as when it was freshly made.My favorite items that were ordered at our table were Amy's pizzas.  My sister ordered the Garlic Chicken Mushroom pizza and our friends ordered the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, half of it made spicy.  Both pizzas had a wonderful crust which was thin with a perfect mix of crispness on the outside and softness in the center.  These were perfectly cooked.  The spicy sausage and pepperoni pizza was so good that I can't wait to go back.  The initial bite wasn't that spicy, but then it hits you and tingles your lips and tongue.  The spice was unlike anything I've had on pizza and it was so incredible.  The Garlic Chicken Mushroom was wonderful too, perfectly balanced flavors and very fresh.  The cheese and herbs on the pizza made for a nice bite.  Amy really knows how to cook a tasty pizza.  She checked in with us to see how we liked everything.  Our tables was thrilled with the food.Last but not least, we ordered dessert.  I had the best key lime pie of my life and my husband has a chocolate truffle cake, topped with mousse and covered in chocolate.  That cake was so rich and wonderful.  Her desserts are divine.At the end of our meal, Amy and Samy were gracious enough to take pictures with our entire table.  They really are a lovely couple.  They are very nice people with a passion for their restaurant.  It was a pleasure to meet them in real life and not just make assumptions on who they were based on what we saw on TV.We had such a wonderful visit to Amy's Baking Company that I find it hard to believe much of anything I saw on Kitchen Nightmares.  For this reason, I say you shouldn't judge the place until you try it.    I give them five stars.  This place is as good as it gets in my opinion and my husband and I will be back for date night.  The ambiance is great here, perfect for a romantic dinner.  Please try Amy's Baking Company for yourself.    There doesn't seem to be  a lot of ""reality"" in reality television."
2013-07-15,lX84alrS89AFMWcRtyu4Ow,"I'm really dabbling between one and two stars on this one. Of course my boyfriend and I were drawn in because of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Unfortunately, we didn't experience any screaming battles, employee walk outs, or any of Amy's or Sami's crazy fits. However, the food was terrible and the service was more than awkward. We walked in, and the place is actually decorated pretty well. But the decor is overshadowed by loud music playing. The music is the awkwardly exotic-sounding music you hear at cheap massage places or at an Asian nail parlor. Also, when we walked in there were like three girl servers just standing at the door that were staring at us through the glass doors before we went in. Terrible atmosphere, super awkward.We initially went in to have dessert, but were intrigued to see if the food really was as bad as it was on the show, so we sat and had dinner. Our waitress sat us down and was very hover-y. She gave us about 1 minute to look over the menu before asking us what we wanted. We had to tell her twice that we were still looking. Feeling rushed, we ordered the three meatball appetizer, I got the pesto potato gnocchi, and my boyfriend got the Greek salad with chicken. She took our order and came back shortly with our two Diet Cokes, and shortly after, the meatballs. The meatballs came out and they LITERALLY smelled like dog food. The kind of dog food that is a gelatinous mess of emulsified unmentionables that keeps its shape when it comes out of the can. Not to mention they were about the diameter of a quarter. Three quarter-sized meatballs for five dollars. Absolutely ridiculous. Upon taking a bit, they were absolutely charred and overcooked to the point that there was a black crust on the outside of them. They tasted pretty much like unseasoned, overcooked ground beef. Not too appetizing. The whole time we were eating the nasty meatballs, Amy came out of the kitchen and was seriously staring at us from behind the counter the whole time.Not much later, our entrees came out. They brought my boyfriends salad, which didn't have the chicken on it. Excited to get a moment to complain, he called the waitress over, but she had a bowl of greasy chicken nibletts in it and she pretty much just placed in on our table. I though it was weird that the ""freshly grilled"" chicken came out in a separate bowl smothered in grease as if it were pan fried or sauteed.... The Greek salad literally tasted like a mix of play-doh and chemicals. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, but the olives were really disgusting, and were what gave the salad the play-doh taste. The salad dressing made it taste like turpentine. My food was definitely much more awkward. My ""pesto"" potato gnocchi came out as the tomato basil gnocchi, but I'm not the type, even at a good restaurant, to send things back. Anyhow I ate it, and upon chewing the gnocchi, it stuck to the inside of my mouth like a dog with peanut butter. They were slimy and pretty large, so it literally felt like there were rubber balls in my mouth. The sauce was as bland as could be, and didn't even taste like tomato and basil. Whatever. When the waitress came back a million times to ask how it was, of course we said ""great"" to avoid and flare ups. We said the same thing when Sami, the owner, came by as well. We decided to try dessert, as it was the only thing Chef Ramsay said was even edible. We got a super tiny flourless chocolate cake. It was good but it was definitely not worth $8. The bill came to $50 dollars. Absolutely not worth it. When we got the bill, Sami stared at us until we signed the check and added a tip. I was REALLY inclined to not add a tip, however, with him awkwardly staring it got the job done. The meal was terrible and the service was awkward and subpar. It was an interesting expereince, but no, we probably wont ever be back. Pictures of our food are available!"
2014-10-16,WwW0bh9cXtyl4ruIKjlAqg,"I'm not going to lie - I came here with my girlfriend to see if any drama would ensue...not with us, but with other patrons.  We also were coming here because it was steps away from the movie theater which we headed to after our dinner.  When we walked in, there were 2 men sitting at a table eating and chatting with Sam (one of the owners).  Sam greeted us and said we could sit anywhere we wanted.  He also joked that as we were 2 ladies coming in, we could sit with these 2 gentlemen if we wanted to.  We all giggled and my girlfriend and I chose a 4-top a few tables away.  Other than that, the restaurant was empty.  It is decorated nicely and the pastries in the pastry window looked divine.  Our server approached us and I couldn't help but notice her ""uniform"" shirt saying, ""I speak Feline, Meow!""  We placed our orders, which were taken on an iPad by the server.  I ordered Amy's Signature Homemade Soup of the Day - Lobster bisque with roasted corn ($7).  It was delicious and I gobbled it up.  I believe it also had some pearl onions in there which was a nice touch.  My friend and I split Amy's Homemade Lemon Garlic Hummus with flat bread ($8).  We loved it.  It was tasty with that hint of lemon that was not overpowering.  We scooped up that hummus until there was nothing left in the dish.  For our entrees, my friend ordered the Sweet & Spicy Asian Peanut Salad ($10).  She enjoyed every bite.  I also enjoyed it too and found myself eating off her plate several times!  I originally ordered the Pearl Couscous Salad ($10) but Amy came back and said they were out of that entree.  I ordered the Orzo Pesto Pea Salad ($10) instead.  It was not my favorite, but it was still good.  For some reason I thought it was going to be warm by it's appearance, but how could it be if it was a salad, right?  So my first bite I was caught off guard at the coldness of it all.  The peas were perfectly crunchy and worked well with the orzo.  We wanted to get some dessert but we were running behind for our movie, so we said we'd have an excuse to come back another day.  I also heard that they recently changed their menu to be more cost and health friendly.  I do wish they still had some pasta dishes as that was what I was craving when we first arrived.  But her menu consists of only soup, salad and sandwiches.  Amy and Sam were very friendly.  After eating their food and realizing that it really is good - and seeing Amy work her butt off in the back making sure the plate-ups looked acceptable, I felt for this couple and as my friend and I later discussed - this is a restaurant that they, as a couple, put their heart and soul in.  Then came Gordon Ramsay who ripped them to shreds - and who knows, maybe their food WAS horrible then, but if you really think about it, Gordon wasn't very ""nice"" about how they ran their show (and I know, I know, GR is known to be a shrew) - and I think for anyone who has a lot of pride of what they are representing and to have someone come in and put you on blast, you can't help but be a bit defensive.  It obviously went too far, but I guess once things start going downhill, it just snowballs and at that point, you lose control  And the people who come in and you see them on the news for Amy and Sam lashing out again, I truly believe are people who purposely come in and antagonize them.  Because what we experienced was a very pleasant and friendly couple with above-par food and service.  Note:  Sam still controls the register though - the server just stands there and waits while he rings up the transaction ... so odd. I gave this place 3 stars instead of 4 because when I think of dinner, I think of something more ""heavy"" and not just soups and salads...and I think of sandwiches for lunch.  It was still good and we'd definitely come back again next time we watch another movie in that plaza."
2010-08-11,gAmmEZLSdj5KXvOlPUQRfQ,"Aside from what I've read so far about the hoopla... here is my experience. I can definitely say that I was cautious but I was trying to stay open-minded.After a few hours of shopping, I got hungry and wanted to get some dinner before heading home. As I walk in, Samy greets me and seats me by the window, there was one other customer other than me already there. Kinda slow night I guess, but it was Wednesday night. As I look over the menu, I was craving pasta..the Garlic Mushroom Chicken sounded good.. I told Samy that I would like that, and he said ""pizza?"" I said, ""Oh no, um, sorry, I thought that was pasta,"" as I quickly scan the menu again. ""Don't worry, my wife can make you the pasta with those ingredients if you like."" ""Sure"", I say, a little impressed that he was trying to customize it. The other customer and across the restaurant started talking to me, which was a little strange, but I guess I started talking back since we were the only two people eating. He moves from his table over to mine, trying to share his pizza. I felt a bit awkward, but I knew he was trying to be nice.Samy comes by and starts chatting with us, he says that they have been in business for 3 years, he's from Israel, how his wife is the chef, etc. etc. It almost seemed surreal since I kept thinking of how they were acting on the news, it was a completely different attitude.. (yeah, I know, a whole different scenario as well).. but he did tell me a lot about his life and asked me questions as well.The Chicken Fettuccine was really rich, could have used more chicken (or bigger pieces), but was not bad. I was stuffed pretty quickly. Samy came by and asked how the food was, 'good' I replied. A couple that they knew came in and Amy came out and chatted with them for a bit, so it seems to me that they rely most of their business through friends of friends and such.Do I think the food was terrible? Not by any means, but I only had one dish. I think they were wrong (and definitely hurt themselves, by the way business looks) by lashing out at Joel, but I did feel welcomed while I was there. Maybe because it was slow, maybe they felt like being over-friendly because they lost potential customers, but I was expecting a lot worse. As I leave, Samy and Amy are still talking to the couple, but Samy remembered to thank me on my way out.My guess is that ABC has been hurting from all this and is trying to step up their game in customer service, in which I kinda felt bad for them, so I guess this experience was 'A-OK'."
2013-05-22,qzRHQKy7MVYO8-fWQU81dA,".I ACTUALLY ATE THERE LAST NIGHT!!  - Unlike 99% of the ""reviewers"" here!(Check the photo album for a pic of my receipt) (I ate there Tuesday, May 21-- The Grand Reopening night)We were invited to the grand reopening and got the first reservations at 5:00.  We were the first two parties seated when they opened the doors.Yes, Samy was there working the front of the house and Amy was doing the cooking.  There was a crowd waiting but you had to be on ""the list"" to get in. It seemed like they sat 2 tables every few minutes so they didn't get slammed with 100 orders all at once.There were reporters and gawkers all over outside but also Scottsdale police, security and the PR people guarding the door. They also had a professional video crew and photographers inside. We had to sign waivers to get in..We were the first seated.  It was obvious that the staff was probably all brand new and understandably quite awkward with their first very customers. We ordered the infamous ""truffle oil"" bacon burger and a pizza.  After ordering, just like on the show, the servers were grouped behind Samy, looking over his shoulder, waiting for him to enter their orders into the terminal.  The food came out in a fairly reasonable amount of time and was actually quite good.  The pizza was perfectly cooked and the nice thick burger was tasty and moist but not at all ""soggy"".  The burger was $14.50 and didn't include fries, but did have a small garnish salad on the side of the plate. It looked hand formed and was more than an inch thick.  The pizza was quite good and a pretty darn reasonable value. Samy came over a few times to ask how things were and when he saw us all typing into our phones and taking pictures of our food,  he just asked us only to think for ourselves, be fair, and tell the truth.   We were there for just about 2 hours but that was mostly because they were slow getting started after being closed for days, had a brand new crew and were also managing the circus there.  We asked about Amy.  Samy said she personally cooks every single meal and could not step out of the kitchen.  We did spot her a few times and sure enough was speeding around working her butt off in the kitchen.   As we were leaving, I began to think the drama on the show was actually real.  Samy was nice enough,  but clearly the stress was building and that's not good for someone who doesn't seem to handle stress well.  As the place began getting more full and the flow was going, there were 15 or so tables in play.  They were in various stages of being seated, ordering, eating, paying and waiting to be bussed, the wheels began to come off.  He politely asked us how everything was but as I briefly responded he began to loudly clap his hands together, as you would at a bad dog,  and yell at a bus boy about not doing his job and his need to listen for the bell.  So bottom line, the food was much better than it looked on TV but I saw enough to believe the volatile personalities, and subsequent trainwreck, were very real.I've received a few questions about the waiver:There were a bunch of TV stations and newspaper reporters there but they were being chased away from the door by the security guards and actual Scottsdale police.Inside was a photographer and a video crew taping everything.  The waiver was a pretty standard ""You know we're taping this, we're not paying you and we can do whatever we want with the tape"" type deal.  I'm not sure what the taping was for, but they weren't intrusive.."
2013-08-20,A0j21z2Q1HGic7jW6e9h7A,"A group of twelve of us came here after a movie one evening and even though the service was slow, the dessert and espresso was ""A-OK"" good.Yes, we watched in horror the meltdown on TV a few months ago.  But, the night we were here, there was no sign of that stuff.  Sammy was our server and he seemed somewhat confused, since we initially asked for six separate checks.  But in the end, one of us picked up the tab after getting tired of waiting.  Since Amy's was half empty, he came over and chatted with us.  Hard to believe, but he was friendly, personable and yes, funny.  The desserts were outstanding.  I don't know who made them, but they were very good.My friend Richard S was with us that evening. He has gone back a few times and loves the place.  And no, he hasn't watched the TV episode.  At this point I have mixed feelings about recommending Amy's.  Yelp friends Ursula, Cheryl and Monica have all had positive experiences, while my friend Marvin hates the place.  So, I'll let you decide."
2013-06-03,Kgmvv8Y7WJLNOvbIiKHCoA,My wife insisted we stop by for dessert because of the hype after eating across the street at Fate.  As fate would have it the place was fairly empty so we thought lets give it a shot.  While we were waiting Sammy started yelling at the table next to us and we noticed fruit flies on the desserts.  We then politely told the waitress thanks but no thanks. Drove to Sweet Republic for a nice ice cream instead.

2013-12-25,djP46l4v0TQTqhLa-ZB1xw,"I would just ignore any very negative review written by a one timer from out of state. They are just aiming to incite. Secondly, I would advise Amy and Samy to avoid reading anything written about themselves because people make a game of it.I ate at ABC last Saturday night. Place was not too busy, hard to park due to the movies next door. Samy greeted us, There was no wait staff, just Samy. But he pulled it off, We got a salad and entrees. the pizza Marguerite was really good. I am picky about crust and the texture was good. Salads were also fresh and good. $12 or so but fresh and tasty. Place was spotless and it was interesting watching the tards outside trying to get a glimpse inside. Except for having to wait a bit for our bill because they were busy and understaffed, we had a great experience. I have certainly had worse at some top rated restaurants around town. Give them a break."
2012-09-14,CUMaqXDakJeMTkUjpI8FxA,A wonderful neighborhood secret.  An excellent and wide selection of foods with a Mediterranean inspiration.  Very nice wine and beer selection with friendly prices.  Deserts are to die for.  The name of Amy's Baking Company is real - and deserts are Amy's passion.  The owners are here every day.  A Scottsdale must!
2013-10-25,ShcOJmQ6btAqy8JcufwqLg,I went here with a friend to waste some time before our movie. We had both seen the kitchen nightmares video of this restaurant. I had previously been in before I watched the video and loved the food. I was absolutely shocked when I saw the video. We walked in to the lovely restaurant and was greeted by Sammy. We picked out our deserts and sat down. Then Amy came out and greeted us. I absolutely loved the service here and will most certainly be back!!
2015-03-14,L1sOpji-ATj0CMETwvFShQ,Wow what an experience. I do give one star for ambiance. I mean this was so bad. If you saw you like it you are fooling yourself or getting paid by the owners. I went with my girlfriend and she had her ID held by Sammy for over 30 minutes when she ordered wine. We had to ask for it back with the check. The pizza was burnt on the top and bottom and raw in the middle. We both almost spit it out. When we asked for a to go box Sammy got aggressive and proceeded to ask over and over why we didn't want to eat. Since we were the only people in the restaurant on a Friday night at prime dinner hour. I avoided conflict and said I needed to get to the airport for a business trip. He continued to push until we left with our pizza to go (we left it on the patio). Thank god there is a great pita place next door we went to for dinner. If I had eaten anymore I would have been sick.
2013-06-11,DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA,"I went to Amy's Baking Company last week for a UYE dinner/going away dinner for Chrystalle B.  yelp.com/events/scottsda…  This whole event came about during a discussion at the May International Supper Club.  We were fresh off the UYE to view the Ramsay Nightmare's show and of course the curiosity was overwhelming.  Somehow the suggestion to celebrate Chrystalle's going away at Amy's Baking Company came up.  Being the naturally tentative, yet curious person I am, I immediately warned... ----DON'T""T POST THIS AS A UYE...--- and ---- I'll show up, but I'm parking in the parking lot and waiting for a ""coast is clear"" sign-----.  NONE of my concerns were founded last Friday.  and I mean NONE.  Here's a picture of the group yelp.com/biz_photos/amys… Everyone else arrived around 7pm.  I got there about 8.  I was welcomed at the table by our very friend server, Debi, and she took my order.  I ordered the Blue Ribbon Burger, Med-well  yelp.com/biz_photos/amys…. Yes, I ordered the burger that Ramsay famously trashed on the show.  That burger was so very good.  The bun that it was served on may have had a little bit too much butter on it, but it was delicious.  The burger was awesome.  I love bleu cheese and bacon and mushrooms... do you see the pic?  they were piled on top of that burger.  The burger it self was cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I could only eat half of it, but I finished it off the next day. The pastries looked AMAZING.  i did not try any, but everyone that ordered said they were delicious with the biggest vote going to the candy bar pastry.To top it off, they split our bill x-number of ways in the most painstaking way.  I was so appreciative of the effort that they put forth on a Friday to accommodate our ever growing party.I'm giving them a 4-star primarily based on that burger and the service.  When I consider the the fact that the restaurant was very nicely decorated and it was super clean I would say it was a solid 4 star experience for me.    I must say that we saw amy and samy, but like any good restaurant, the owners were not show-boating their way around the restaurant, because they were worried about preparing amazing food.  And great food was served at our table that day."
2013-06-08,HmILc-lgVKZS7mWNdYCSJw,"I went to Amy's with an open but curious mind, as usual an empty stomach and a taste for adventure! We went to say goodbye to our friend who is moving to DC & to do what us yelpers do best, try something new, eat, drink & write a review!We were greeted by the infamous Sammy who in minutes accomodated our request for numerous tables to seat our group of which most had yet to arrive! I told him of my admiration of the pretty chandeliers,& decor of the restaurant, he responded in kind about their food, complimented his wife and gave me a hug! Yes surprised me too! In a daze I moved on distracted by the display of several desserts. I was greeted by Amy who when I told her I loved the desserts sprinkled in edible glitter & she cracked a joke, then complimented my friend's shirt! We were seated & greeted by our friendly server Debbie with water & drinks quickly filled, & refilled faster than we could drink by more friendly servers. After finally deciding I attempted to order the Salmon Burger but was informed it wasn't available, disappointed I quickly selected  the portabella mushroom burger. Debbie was quicker to inform me that it was a mushroom not really a burger in case I wasn't aware, a misconception she said had frequently been made by others(secrets out I thought the same thing lol) pays to read but I went with it anyway! My friend and I agreed to do a split & share to try each others selection, she ordered a lemon chicken panini, crispy on the outside tender and soft on the inside. Both were tasty, although after tasting mine I regretted not keeping it all for myself, who knew a mushroom posing as a burger could taste so good!  After gazing at the display case we agreed to share a dessert, the candybar topped, layered in cream, filled with mousse, sitting on a pie shaped brownie and yes to my delight sprinkled in edible glitter! We were quick to make it a disappear, glitter and all!We enjoyed an evening of good food, and great service!!Despite what you may have heard or read about Amy's, may I suggest trying it for yourselves, you might be as I was pleasantly surprised!Thank you Amy's Baking Company for a memorable & delightful evening!"
2010-08-04,T_kpvu1nkNKIdCXUzEYb8g,"I have debated about writing since i heard about the Joel/Amy battle, but decided to put in my two cents.  I first went to Amy's quite a few years ago when they first opened.  I had heard from several family members who had happened by and bought dessert.  Knowing how big of a dessert fiend I was the alerts kept coming.  From my first experience I was sold.  It was not just the desserts though the other food was very good and I brought several people in to dine there.In general most people thought it was overpriced, but my husband and I don't normally let that stop up unless it is obscene.  My employees even bought me a red velvet cake from there and got me a gift certificate.Well for whatever reason we didn't go there for a little while and when we did go there was a sign saying that it was closed as Amy had health problems.  We were very sad.  I had met Amy several times and I will tell you she is passionate about her food and when encountering foodies she is very excited to talk about it.  I watched the website and then one day they were back.  The day we went we had just spent the night on the far west side of the valley after going to party that lasted very late and had a bit of alcohol.  We live on the east side and I was really excited that we could go to Amy's on the way around the 101.  When we got there it was relatively early on a Sunday and we were alone but for one other table.  We quickly went to work with the menu and ordered several things knowing we would have wonderful food to take home.  Where things went amiss is when we went to play a game while waiting for our food.  Amy's husband came over and to be honest I can't remember exactly what he said (I am forever mortified by the whole experience) but we were essentially told they were not ""that kind of place"" and we were not welcome.  We had just gotten beverages and I told my husband just to pay for it and let's go.  I am not a public scene kind of person and I was very upset.  The server didn't want to come near us as I recall she wouldn't make eye contact and even hid behind the counter.   Finally the husband rang it up and out we went. At that point I didn't want to eat anywhere I just wanted to go home.  I have never even discussed this with anyone but my family that saw me after when we picked up our dogs.  (Dogs that once upon a time sat on Amy's patio while we enjoyed our food.)   My husband called them afterwards. To my further mortification he spoke directly with Amy and she defended her husband and their decisions about what goes on at their restaurant.  Now I don't disagree with them saying no games at their restaurant.  It is their place and that means their rules, but it was just the way it was handled.  You can't go around making people feel less than and in Amy's response to Joel it was very clear again that there are some strong prejudices occurring.  Obviously I won't ever go back and the gift certificate long sits in a drawer unused.  There are places in town that are better and many more that are worse, but overall it is customer service that ultimately will make the difference."
2010-08-05,c2fTfmKEdFDp82GIQqPYKA,"I visited Amy's in July of 2009. I will be honest, the food was ok, the desserts were DIVINE, but yet I had not desire to go back. After hearing about the brouhaha between the owner and a reviewer, I had to write one myself. When I went, I had awful service too. I sat indoors (I really think Joel must have been crazy to sit on the patio in the summer in Phx), but the waitress took over 5 minutes to greet me, 5 more minutes to bring me my drink and come take my order, she couldn't knowledgeably answer questions about the menu, and she failed to ask if I wanted anything else...I had to order my dessert to go because she took so long to come back to the table. The environment is not a very friendly one and I am not surprised that Joel had that experience ( I was dining alone as well). Your experience can be colored by your frame of mind and single guests often want to talk and be ""entertained,"" so to speak by the waiters--especially when it's their first time. I won't lie, the pizza I had was DELISH, something with capers and anchovies (I know, not for everyone) and I was very impressed with my dessert, which I ate at home, but I don't like the service and that's 70% of the experience. Bottom line is that they're not irreplaceable because their product, while good, isn't overly unique and the service is the tipping point into ""why bother."" If someone else really wanted to go there, I'd go, but as for me, probably never again because of this:Dear Joel,L. It is blatantly obvious to me why you were ALONE on a Saturday night! Read any of the reviews that have been written about us and you will see that EVERYONE loves us!! The only people that don't  is our ""Competition"". We knew you had been sent by another restaurant before you even ordered your $14.00 Pizza. The Pizza was fresh and amazing. The reason the tomatoes had different texture was because I use three different heirloom tomatoes and some of them are sundried. So of course they are going to have a different texture from the fresh ones!!!But perhaps you are only accustomed to tasting the ones that come ""fresh from the can!""Moving on to the ""Store bought Dough"" Comment. PLEASE!! My dough is made fresh every day from 100% organic ingredients. Perhaps your palate is not sophisticated enough to tell the difference.As for you having the Patio all to yourself unless you have been living on another PLANET it is summertime in ARIZONA MORON!!! Only TRAMPS and LOSERS want to sit outside in 110 temperatures!!!!We are hiring because we are so busy that we need to hire more people. You just so happened to come right after a huge rush. And the people did not change their mind for the Margarita Pizza they ordered. They were still enjoying their amazing Caesar salad and I thought perhaps you would appreciate not having to wait so long for your pizza.  Which was just coming out of the OVEN.I am the CHEF and the owner, and I am the one that made your Pizza.As for the no smoking comment everyone knows that it is against the LAW to smoke within 20 feet of a public place. But perhaps you think you are above the LAW. Have a little respect not everyone wants to subject themselves to being around second hand smoke.And as for the overpriced menu items if you think that $12.00 is too much for an ENTRÉE sized ORGANIC Salad or $14.00 is too much for an AMAZING Pizza then perhaps you should go to the PITA JUNGLE that is just a stone's throw away. And if you get lucky maybe you can even dig up someone up to take with you so you can share a $5.00 Falafel.Do US a favor and keep your ugly face and you ugly opinions to yourself and go back to the restaurant that you really work at!!I would LOVE for anyone who reads this review to come to ABC and try our Pizza. If you don't like it then I guarantee you don't have to pay for it.""*Amy needs to understand that your food can be utterly fabulous, but you MUST control your urge to vent on public forums. Reputation is important and hers and the business' will suffer because of her ill-conceived actions."
2013-06-08,bpgbVPJcG-wQ4cNBcPPIxw,"Let me start off by saying I am not paid by anyone and am writing a true and honest review about my experience while dining at Amy's Baking Company.My friend is leaving the valley moving to DC and I wanted to have a farewell dinner with a bunch of friends and Amy'a was the place we picked. I did send a reservation request via email and never heard anything back and when calling them the phone just rings, but I decided this wasn't going to stop me from going. Showed up around 6:30 Friday night and spoke directly to Sammy, explained that I needed a table for 14 by 7 that I had been trying to call to give heads up but no avail. Sammy explained that its been a lil hard keeping up with the calls and email and he had a table set up and ready for us. Sammy was nothing but nice, friendly and helpful. While the table was being set my friend and I were eyeing the beautiful dessert display and Amy came out said hi to us and even joked around with my friend.Our sever was Debbie and she was amazing, made sure our table was taking care of, there were some new severs and Sammy was teaching them the proper way of severing, but not in a mean way but as in a father teaching his kid. Sammy also came to our table to see how we are doing.I ordered the lemon chicken panini and my friend ordered the portabello burger, we spilt our dish to be able to try both, the lemon chicken panini was good, the chicken was very tender and juicy, the bread was cooked perfect, this was a good panini, perfectly toasted and very favorable. The portabello burger, that was surprising good, the bun was amazing, this too is a great lil sandwich.We ordered the candy cake for dessert and let me tell you, AMAZING!! Oh my gawd that's a good lil piece of dessert. The check came and Sammy split it up for us, at this point we were a party of ten and there wasn't any issue with us all splitting it up. It was a great meal, service was excellent, Sammy and Amy were friendly. I do see me coming back, those desserts are calling my name.I also have to add I went there with an open mind but unsure how the night would go and that I had a pleasurable time. After everyone paid and left my friend and I went to talk to Sammy, we told him we are Yelpers who wanted to give there place a try and thanked him and Amy for the great evening. Sammy was not upset by this but told us thank you and didn't say a bad word towards us or Yelp but was happy we gave them a chance, would I go back to Amys? Yes I will."
2011-10-03,6CbNnrhmjcGLX_FM1vvVrg,"The minute I read boulangerie my imagination flies...so we went to check their desserts and the sparkling decoration should have been enough to avoid any temptation. I made the mistake to order a white chocolate coconut pie...terrible! I don't like to bake, but I can prepare something more tasteful. This was a get together of lots of sugar and not any definition of flavor. Compared to a citrone tarte from a boulangerie in Seattle...this was a pooor pooor performance.On the other hand, my friend ordered a Crème brûlée. Now this one was very very decent! I should have gone with something like that. Surprisingly, a lady came to inspect our deserts and complained she was not allowed to have desert unless she had food first. REALLY? hahahha or was she just out of her mind."
2013-07-04,pq8Sp_vicEda2weV1KKxRg,"This place is great if you want to lose weight.  The wait for the food is about 2 hours.  After I finally got the food I was starving, tried my best to eat it.  Threw up four times later that day."
2013-07-16,23HZuznFUHtqLfvOJrGN1Q,"Have gone a few times over the past years never thought it was great or bad, just a local neighborhood place with a nice outdoor cafe.  A few weeks ago an out of town guest wanted to go and I gave in.  It was really good!  Nice atmosphere, I had never had dinner or eaten inside before, we all thought our dinners were great and the desserts were outstanding."
2013-08-26,lKPUyA6DveoWk-3zFrHA9w,"I came here with a bunch of friends a month or so ago, mostly because of the all the bad press it received and we just wanted to see for ourselves.  Shockingly, it was delicious!I enjoyed a glass of wine and ordered the gnocchi sauce on the spaghetti because as much as I love gnocchi, I was really in the mood to twirl noodles around my fork.  Well, as it usually happens when you make substitutions, it came out wrong.  The waitress wasn't thrilled to be bringing it back (I've seen the show so it's no wonder), but she did and my pasta came out quickly thereafter and it was delicious.  I ended up eating the whole serving even!  I also had bites of a couple of different kinds of pizza, a bite of the burger and of course, some bites of desert.  All was excellent and if I'm in the area, I will not hesitate to come back.  Great job Amy's!"
2014-06-05,6Nk8WX1STMTEuKjmRlrh6A,"After my initial review of this place, I received many compliments and some not so nice messages. So I am updating my review to include Dinner and Dessert. My husband and I went several weeks ago. My impression is that of 4 star, hubby felt more like 3 star review.Here's why:1. Samy is a little too much for what they are trying to give a fine dining experience. It's nice to stop by tables and say hello, but the feeling is a bit rushed overall and his energy that he gives off is a bit overwhelming. Amy and Samy are nice people, and Lord knows they have been put through some bad press and people. Hubby suggested to me and I have to agree that Samy would be best placed not as hands on as he is. Let the server do their jobs.2. If you are going to charge fine dining prices, then be sure to use fine dining tablecloths and fine dining napkins. I understand about cutting corners to save money but to truly be more upscale you have to spend some money on things like that.3. The dessert truly remains and still stands as excellent in both of our books. We took ours to go. Use smaller see through containers and please don't group the desserts in the same box. I was surprised when it came to our table together in the same box. Truly a lovely box for sure, but you could save some money there. And $10 for each dessert is excessive. Sorry but very true! 4. Music...set the music to agree with the great food.5. Amy is a wonderful cook and baker, no doubt about it. I loved her bolognese lasagna and for those that say anyone can make a lasagna well that is not always true. Nice portion, firm, flavorful and absolutely tasty with pepperoni. Makes my mouth water thinking about it again and wanting more. 6. Hubby had what he described as a confused menu item in the Pasta Rustica. To be sure when he mentioned it to Amy she agreed with him, and then he wondered why it's still on the menu. He said it was good but didn't feel the ingredients went together as well as they should have.7. Flat bread pizza was perfectly cooked and loved every bite of it.I am a fan of Gordon Ramsey, but  I am also a fan of both Amy and Samy. I want these people to succeed, and the food is worth it, so please set aside your opinions and give them a chance, and try to support this couple and restaurant in being the great place I know it's capable of being. And to Samy and Amy with just a few imrpovements and REAL reviews like the one I have just written, I know things can get better for you. Do think about adding an ipad to the front so people can place their reviews online at the time of paying their bill. See you again soon!"
2013-06-27,IXSTfBSe56Z0RvYg4Cfn2w,Ok to be honest we decided to check this place out because of the media and show Kitchen Nightmares.  I did see the show and I couldn't believe the behavior of the owners.  We both agreed not to buy food off the menu. But we both agreed to try the pastries in the glass case. I just have to say that her cakes are delicious. They are very pretty too.   I did not get to see the craziness that worked in the kitchen. I did have a little conversation with the husband husband about the sweets behind the glass. He was kind to us and friendly. My friend actually felt I bit sorry for him.  I did see the show and kept my guard up. I can tell he was keeping a close eye on every single person that walked in that door. So I didn't take pictures on the down low just because I was afraid he would break my phone.  We had a really helpful server I felt sorry for just cause I am sure she never gets her tips. Ok now to my pie ... I got the white chocolate coconut pie. It was not overly sweet it was just right for me. It was actually perfect. I will say good things about good things that I experience.  And that pie was good. If I am ever in area to satisfy my craving for good desserts I will stop here.  I am hesitant on the meals there. Just because of some reviews and what I have seen on tv. Oh well who knows I might if I get talked into it. Oh parking sucks just thought I would throw that in too.
2013-06-13,JBotsuf4thD_378Z23Zc2w,"I went here I have the receipt to prove it. The food is horrible and is not fresh, the owners are rude when I complained they said I was there to complain and stated I was one of those bullies. stay far away from this place"
2013-08-17,2gmKNhmQrS5bGo518WWzcw,"I'd put zero stars if it was an option- the food was horrible, the atmosphere was tense and the owner some older guy was rude when asked how much longer it would be after waiting well over an hour for a burger and a salad. Do not bother wasting your money here there are many other better options in Scottsdale"
2013-12-28,9x-dX9UAx2JZdeB-nlVc2w,"I'm a little ashamed to admit this, but I came here strictly due to the crazy publicity. I was surprised at how nice the owners were to us.   However, Sami said three times to us to come back for dinner as it's delicious.  Owners shouldn't have to try to convince customers that many times in the five minutes there.   I actually enjoyed the chocolate macaroon.  The apple pie was the worst I have ever had.  Excessively sweet and way too much cinnamon.   Way too expensive for what we bought.  Seems more of a tourist trap than anything.  Guilty!"
2013-05-26,i2dkuiHX0WzQqDDnoQLg-Q,We stopped by after dinner to try the dessert and check out the hype. Both owners were there and it was quite entertaining. 1st the food: candy bar tart had a center that was not sweet. The edges were sweet and tasty but the middle was not so tasty. We also tried the chocolate sponge cake dipped in chocolate. This was delicious. Now the entertainment. We asked Amy for an autograph and she was very happy to oblige us. My friend then told Amy and her husband how they were like Jodi Arias and they laughed. Sami then spoke to us and defended his tip fiasco and proceeded to talk about kitchen nightmares and how Gordon wont talk to them. Just amusing. The place is nice and we will head back for dinner and more entertainment.
2014-08-15,DB5uuOamJ5N2RZ5ylqOFQw,"So, as promised we went back and the service was great. Sammy talked a lot about showing Gordan Ramsay wrong. Although, it seemed it lite a fire under them. We will be going back.  Maybe, this was a lucky night. The dip was amazing. I loved my pasta. The only thing we had an issue with we went at 130pm and a sign on the door said will reopen at 4pm.  This was much better then our first visit."
2014-10-14,p_2daiuEk774FFHsKrCAlg,"Apparently Amy was in a bad mood, or didnt like me taking pictures on front of store as they made me leave, and all I was doing was taking pics of the front of Amys bakery and walking in checking in on the Yelp app, I wasnt going to get food here, but I ddi want to get some pie since I saw that Ramsey liked it. Maybe if there is a next time, and I go in I wont have the cell phone out= pretty amazing IMO and never had that problem with other companies."
2012-11-17,XmIsBXpdBevTYCe8gKQruQ,"We were very disappointed with this restaurant.  The food and service were average (3 Star).  However, it was disappointing seeing the owner turn away a family of four with two young children citing that reservations were required when the restaurant was only a third occupied. Two minutes later a couple came into the restaurant and were immediately seated at a table for 4 without reservations.  As parents, it was seeing this discrimination that resulted in our overall grade of 1 star.I am attaching the response I received from the Owner below.  I think it illustrates his attitude toward customer service:**** Owner Response *****Hello Stephen,Yes I did refuse a family this evening without reservations; I actually refused hundreds of people earlier, as I do every weekend.Last time I checked I have every legal right to refuse service to anyone. I did not refuse this family due to the fact that they had children with them I refused them because they did not have a reservation. If you think that my Restaurant deserves one star because of that, and if you feel better about yourself by posting some stupid, pointless review on YELP, then perhaps next time you should eat at The Pita Jungle. We send tons of people like you to them on a daily basis. So enjoy!!Additionally perhaps you should be Man enough to post your picture next to your review. So we can see who you are. It is very easy to hide behind a computer screen while virally attacking hard working business owners. We have a name for people like you. ""The Camel Toe Mafia"". Just a bunch of Pussies hiding behind their computer screen.I am very sorry that I did not refuse you too! Thank You.Samy (the owner)"
2014-04-02,4IA9T5GklQxZJ1k-W_gyUQ,"After all the hoopla about this place my friend and I had to give it a go after seeing a movie at the Harkins. I had the lasagna and she had the fettuccini alfredo with mushrooms.The service was fast, the food very tasty and the atmosphere pleasant. We spoke to both Amy and Samy and they were very friendly and nice to talk to. No, I am not a shill posting this as a favor, I am a real customer and will definitely be back based on my experience today!"
2013-05-22,3wTr01NXVRyc05G5kfQsnQ,"I visited some friends in Phoenix a few months back, and we ended up patronizing Amy's for dinner one night. My friends hadn't tried it yet themselves, so none of us were sure what to expect. We all decided to share some pizza, which wasn't all that great. It wasn't seasoned properly, and at points it felt doughy as if it hadn't been cooked thoroughly enough. Our waitress was nice, but we could tell that she was stressed. It was probably from the owner's occasional yelling and somewhat rude comments. We only stayed at this place about 1.5 hours and were definitely ready to leave once we finished. I didn't feel that the price paid for the quality of food received was justified. The value was certainly lacking.I figured this might have been an isolated incident until I read about this place being featured on ""Kitchen Nightmares"". I found that episode on YouTube and then thought, ""Well if the shoe fits...""."
2015-01-15,4Da2vvJlUDQhUHKDSawJHw,"Went to Amy's Baking Company on a whim while I was in Scottsdale. I had seen them profiled on Kitchen Nightmares and figured why not? When I arrived, Samy was there to greet me. He was such a nice guy! I tried a candy bar tart, which was supurb! As I'm sitting there eating, Amy brought out a meatball pizza for Samy. Dude is so cool, he offers me some. At first, I decline, but he insisted. I asked him to sit and chat with me. We talked about the restaurant, Kitchen Nightmares, and so much more! I am looking forward to my return trip to Amy's Baking Company!"
2014-05-09,4FXbovgSEFZ5_9S5wddFIg,"Eat the Candy Bar Pie/Tart!  It is fantastic.  I have been here about 4-5 times, twice before the TV fiasco and a few times after.  I primarily came here for dessert before or after movies at the Harkins theater and I have to say their desserts are fabulous, and in particular the Candy Bar Pie.  As for the food, I had it for the first time last night.  The hummus with the flat bread was HUGE and you could tell the hummus was made fresh.  The flatbread was perfectly soft-bubbly- and crispy all at the same time, not sure how else to describe it...see the pics.  I had a salad with sweet tomatoes to go with it and the honey dressing.  If I had not eaten so much flatbread I would have cleaned my salad plate.   The lasagna Nydia had looked and smelled delicious, but I will let Nydia tell you about that in her review.  Nydia and I traditionally always start with dessert that way we don't have to worry about saving room for it.  This time we opted for the Peanut Butter-Chocolate cake.  It was rich and tasty!  We did not leave a crumb on the plate.  I still prefer the Candy Bar Pie because it is AMAZING, but I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the desserts!  I should also say I have met the owners every time I have been in to ABC and never had a problem.  Actually, Sammy has always been extremely nice and remembers me even though I have only been in a few times.  But I also have never had any problems with any thing.  I am sure if you put the right person in the restaurant with Samy, it would be like two bowling balls in a china cabinet.  But Nydia and I talked about that and heaven for bid you bring out the Chihuahuas in these 'mezzican' gals even though we are very charming... LOL!  The reason it gets 4 stars is the ambiance, I have only been in one time when it has been busy.  The prices are maybe a bit high, but not horrible.  I thought alcohol prices were steep.  Some people in their reviews are saying these are fine dining prices and they aren't.  You can get a salad for $5 and Chicken Parm for $18.  Our hummus plate was HUGE (pics) and it was $10.  I don't think you should let their publicity deter you from ABC; I think they really are trying to have a great restaurant and they take pride in their food.For the skeptics of my review: ***I don't personally know the owners and have honestly been in less than a handful of times.  I'm sorry I don't have something to whine about other than the lack of people.  You should be more skeptical of 'reality tv'***"
2011-07-09,NhbdlBypGYxeil_VANqDww,Fabulous!  Great service!  Huge portions.  We brought special friendsfor a Birthday Dinner.  We were so proud to introduce them to this fine food.  They said they'll be back soon and so will we.  Wish we'd had room for dessert.  The pastries are out of this world!
2010-08-07,d3xVYe9DDklzIJL5G9KDzQ,"Amy and Samy are two of the nicest most welcoming people you'll meet when dining out and I've done my share of dining out. When we arrive Samy always welcomes us like family and I feel like we are eating at home. Amy is usually in the kitchen busy cooking and baking but always finds time to come out and say hello and bring my mom a special treat. The food in phenomenal, always fresh and of the highest quality. My favorite dish is the Vanilla Bean Coconut Shrimp salad and I love, love, love the key lime pie! I've ordered cakes and pies for special occasions and have never been disappointed. Visit ABC Bistro and experience it for yourself!!"
2014-08-07,I312nHC_wQLzfivckFsqhg,"I was here last week and the place was empty except for Amy playing on her smartphone. When my GF and i came in she said ""Can i help you?"" Like we were lost and looking for directions. Then Samy asked us where we would like to sit. We just came in to have a piece if cake and cappuccino which was excellent but $10 for a piece of cake and $5 for small Cappuccino is hardly inexpensive. This place seems more deli than 5 star priced establishment. Samy was bashing Pita Jungle not sure why, we love it there. He said that his place was better and everything made from scratch and their food is excellent. Good cake but at $10 value is just not there.Thanks"
2013-07-24,HRVReLMC1umM5OEPfD8ywQ,"I did it!  I went there!  I fully admit, I loved the train wreck of an episode that was Kitchen Nightmares, but my 11 year old little girl loved it more and begged to go to this place on our next visit out.  I am working on Mom of the Year so I took her (haha). My 8 year old son was with us.  My sis, her man and his daughter came as well.  THREE kids and according to Yelp this is NOT a good place for kids... gulp!  We were there on July 16 early eve.  I will start with the restaurant and I have not a bad thing to say.  It was clean and it was gorgeous.  The menu was surprising.  For a non-kids place, the menu listed a kiddie pasta dish for $5.  Fabulous!  Our waitress seemed to be making up for the past crazy by being OVERLY sugary sweet.  At first it was nice, but honestly, it got annoying.  We started with hummus and some dipping bread.  This was absolutely delicious.  We also ordered a pepperoni pizza, a ham and cheese Panini, a Caesar salad and the kids pasta.  The food was fairly timely.  Had we no children, I don't think there would have been a rush, but bored kids really emphasize how long it takes to get food in a restaurant.  I am happy to say that all of the food was very good.  My son did not like the pasta, but my sister's BF loved it.  I did send it back to get doctored up with some sauce, and there seemed to be no freaking out in the kitchen over this debacle.  Unfortunately, my son still turned his nose up at it.  I think the problem is that it is a little fancy for a high percentage of kids that are likely used to Prego.  Don't judge me!  That infamous Caesar that was featured on TV was very good.  I think if you read the menu, you won't be surprised.  It actually spelled out what was in the salad so I knew what I was going to be getting.  The pizza was AWESOME and the Panini was very good.  The girls ordered desserts and not only were they gorgeous but they really were wonderful.  Amy even offers a flourless chocolate cake that is gluten-free.  The BEST part was that Amy was very VERY nice to the little girls.  My daughter REALLY wanted to meet Amy.  Not only did she get to meet her, but Amy actually chatted with the kids and took a photo with them.  But she didn't stop there.  She gave the kids some plastic ""Hello Kitty"" rings.I was out in Scottsdale for a visit.  I don't live there.  However, if I did, I WOULD occasionally frequent this place.  If absolutely for nothing else, the dessert case is spectacular and I really don't care who is baking.  And parents!  Put your minds at rest.  I think Amy might like kids almost as much as she likes cats.  Meow!"
2013-02-20,jnJf26dkmW6vowC4eh70PQ,"While waiting for my movie time, I decided to grab lunch at ABC. I asked for coffee which was bitter. I asked for tomato sauce for my cheese tomato panini, i was told that the sauce would be an additional $4. The sandwich was already $10 for just cheese and tomato. The gentlemen owner was not very friendly and would not provide sauce of any kind free. He was also looking at me crudely when I used my phone. I do not recommend this ""snobby"" place.

2013-08-07,as9kh0CBsg1i1JuTIqTqFg,"Like most people probably i went here because I wanted to see what the Kitchen Nightmares hullabaloo was really all about.  Samy was on the floor ""managing"" things, and I saw Amy in the back briefly but she didn't come out front.  Samy is REALLY intense, but his heart seems to be in the right place.  It really does seem like he wants everyone to have a great experience.  His intensity, I think, might simply be cultural, and I would encourage anyone who goes to be patient and know this.  I did watch the show and it seems like Amy is a nut case, but it's reality TV, and the producers could probably make Mother Theresa look cray, so I took that with a grain of salt.  The pastries looks UNBELIEVABLY delicious!!!  If I wasn't trying to lose weight I would have eaten everything in the case.  I had a caprese salad which was fine, but it was July which, to me, means that the tomatoes should be amazing - these tomatoes looked and tasted like they were bought at Safeway and never really ripened.  It was soaked in a little too much dressing as well.  The mozzarella cheese at least was fresh and delicious, but that was about it.  Overall it was fine, and I would recommend trying the pizza that looked delicious, but I'm not sure I'd go again."
2012-07-13,pMpJdotThTIztU9Ax9sQvg,"European style service! (If you have been to Europe you will appreciate the service and ambiance.)  Family owned business. It is always great to support the local economy. Especially with food this good!The chicken and mushroom pizza was amazing, the portions were generous!Definitely save room for dessert! We had the original creme brule, it was delicious!We took home the banana creme brule! This dessert is a gift from heaven! It is hands down the best dessert I have ever had! We will be returning for the pizza and yummy desserts!"
2013-02-12,Vb8-y5MVPWHB5QtFq4GPKw,"We eat here at least 2-3 times a month!  One of those special little hideaways that's perfect for date night or a night out with the family!  Every thing is made to order so if you want fast foot, go to pita jungle or Burger King!  This is fresh, organic, and delicious, made-to-order food!  Samy and Amy are always so warm and welcoming!  The beautiful pastries and desserts are scrumptious and are hand-crafted by Amy herself!  We have our favorites which include the pizza bread, salads, sandwiches, and pastas!  If you're planning on going to a movie, do that first, so that you can linger over the wonderful wines and food and make it a special evening!The decor and ambience is wonderful and we are always treated like part of Samy and Amy's family!  Anyone headed to Scottsdale needs to make ABC/Amy's a must!"
2014-01-18,MAmijW4ooUzujkufYYLMeQ,"Things you may not have known about Amy's Baking Company.  If you have food allergies, they will design a meal just for you which they did for me.  They serve grass fed beef, organic chicken and the most wonderful moroccan rose caffeine free tea.  Celebrated a birthday here and was made extra wonderful by Amy & Samy.  Amy put sparklers on our birthday cake which made my 12 year old laugh silly. Homemade butternut squash soup which comes with a homemade piece of bread with little tiny onions, sage and some homemade creme la fraiche...amazing flavor and usually the soup of the day, couple with the house salad with honey citrus dressing also homemade with organic greens, onions and tomatoes - there house salad was amazing, fresh and huge and only $5.00  other places sell this size salad for double or triple...There pizza dough is light and airy and you can add or subtract any ingredients to make your very own pizza.  I like white pizza especially with the goat cheese, garlic, pesto, basil.  it is very good.  Oh by the way...Amy makes all her desserts, they are not store bought, they are home made by Amy and delicious...I have to try the Lemon Meringue next time was too full this time around.  The ice coffee looked amazing and was huge I mean huge.  If you have food allergies this place is the place to go, they will try their best to accommodate you.  everything is made from scratch, nothing comes from a can, they do not use a corn, potato flours and absolutely no soy products of any kind....There homemade pizza crust, flat bread and buns are melt in your mouth......The price for the pastries are right in line and taste amazing...Once again great service, great conversation, great friends, and great organic made to order food.  Can not get any better than this."
2013-10-16,v7FPnMzdbl6J7U_8H1BWZA,"Awful, owners yell at the workers all the time, they are rude, PIZZA is not cooked.  Be careful about ordering and ask what it is, they do not tell you and you do not know what you are eating.  SERVICE IS AWFUL."
2013-06-18,vPOkQJKahhR13LQ2ElSFGg,"Disclaimer: I am an actual Elite Yelper who actually visited Amy's and was not paid to do so.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. A large group of Yelpers and I came here for my going away dinner. We honestly expected to see a scene like we'd been hearing about for weeks all over social media, we even had a backup restaurant ready. But we were greeted w/ nothing but kindness and smiles. So far so good, right?Then came the ordering. I had the ham and brie panini. So good. SO good. The brie was nice and creamy and complimented the saltiness of the ham and crunchiness of the bread perfectly. I also tried the lemon meringue tart for dessert. I wasnt a huge fan of the consistency of the meringue, but thats some of the best lemon filling and crust ive had. Not one person at my table had a complaint about the food.The service was great too. Debbie was very attentive, as were our water fillers. Man did they keep us hydrated! We even had some people show up late, to our already full table, and it was the furthest thing from a problem. Samy immediately got us chairs, and we squeezed them in just in time for dessert. When it was time for our checks, we asked if they could be seperated. Sometimes its a problem, here it wasnt.I was so happy w/ how the evening went. It was the perfect last dinner w/ my fellow Elites.An altogether great evening. :)"
2015-04-12,u8uswd13j2vuLerIxFSFaw,"Absolutely amazing gourmet menu at fast food prices!  Delicious menu with amazing salads, soups, sandwiches and pastas. Everything made from scratch and fresh with the most incredible ingredients!  Husband and wife shop and the most polite people you will ever meet in your life. Hands down the best place to eat in Scottsdale with homemade from scratch food and pastries!!"
2015-08-11,63RMC0LxibWFTlHOGgseGw,"The three times I've tried to come here while living in AZ, the place was closed. No, I'm not coming at 4am, I'm simply coming during normal business hours! Not even 9am - I'm talking 11am, 3pm, 4pm. Wonderful!I couldn't give a crap what happened on that TV show, I simply wanted to see if their food was good. But alas, I couldn't do that because they were never open without any notice. I don't want to waste my time or money on a spot that can't even simply put a note on the door if they need to be closed in an unlikely situation."
2014-03-10,PYe4-yBJCrtHtKn9AYkgSQ,"I have eaten here just twice.The owners are the rudest people on earth. Took over a  hour for a pizza to be made, when I asked to just pay for my drinks because I got tired of waiting, the old man started to scream and curse at me, banning me from the establishment.  The other time I ate here I tried the pasta and it tasted frozen, not fresh. Didn't mention it at the time because I know chefs can have off days and wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant is okay, saw some dirt and dust. Overall this place should be shut down and the owners need to attend a cooking class."
2014-12-27,_Q4g3iminnouBA3wNFwHIQ,This place was on Kitchen Nightmares and got bad reviews so we checked it out ourselves.  The tomato soup and fresh bread was so yummy!  We also had a cheese panini and a ham/cheese panini were really good too!  I would come back again for sure!
2014-10-16,K1vkd3uaIe_lgkZzkp1xTA,"There were 5 of us trying Amy's after the movies. I give this restaurant 5 stars for food, staff and all of the healthy selections. I had the Sweet/Spicy Asian salad with peanut dressing. Perfect. I have never seen that many ingredients in a salad before. Everything blended well. The deserts, to die for. Please try Amy's, you will never be sorry. Outdoor patio was a great place to people watch and larger than most."
2014-05-10,gBvh8dMYoi2-vQqjzMDvMQ,Amazing food!!! amazing people!!! A must to all!!!Dessert out of this world and the special ice coffeeOMG!!! OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!LOVE IT
2010-08-21,MwvrsmDOdgysTiF4DLqyaw,"I was out with a group of ladies for a mom's night out and we decided to eat here after a movie...We were greeted nicely and seated, and then it went downhill quickly from there.1. It was super hot in that place. I sweat the whole time.2. A friend and I decided to share the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and expected that at $14, the portions would be big enough to do so. They weren't.3. The alfredo sauce was bland.4. No bread with the meals or anything? I thought that was lame. 5. I left hungry.6. Another two of the ladies shared the squash ravioli and it was $22 for FOUR ravioli. They were flat little ravioli. They were perturbed, asked the server if he was serious and he was like, ""YES! This is a million dollar restaurant!"" What? Ok, but 4 ravioli? Good points:1. The wine.2. My friends thought the pizza was good.We pretty much vowed that after such a lousy experience that we'd find it online and make a review."
2011-06-17,QYNyvw53OKvxm3WzResegA,"This beautiful charming bistro is elegant and cozy yet friendly. We stopped in after a movie and we will be back to sample more than the the luscious raspberry champagne cocktail and the not-too-sweet croissant 'bread' pudding. Both delicious! We had an opportunity to visit with both Amy and Samy. They're very friendly and open. Every detail is taken care of here, from the beautiful French cabinetry and decor, to the cleanliness. Amy's pastries are the most beautiful you have seen anywhere.We are looking forward to trying everything on their enticing menu. And sharing ABC with our friends and family."
2014-05-08,XQSVxfyj6KycXOFD0GQKeA,I visited the area and thinking about Kitchen Nightmare show about ABC. So I give myself a gut and try the food there for the first time. There is no half star so I have to give them a full star but this restaurant is totally a joke. Waiting almost 45 mins for the food and the food came out salty and full of oil. There will be a second time here for me.
2014-09-12,8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,"Honestly had a great time at Amy's Baking Company. Vs our visit at Gordon Ramsay restaurant located in Las Vegas (see review). We went on a Friday. Greeted nicely bye our server and Sammy!. We had the pear salad witch had amazing caramelized pecans those are worth the salad alone( Please keep on the menu!). We had 3 mains between the 3 of us. The gnocchi was really good nice flavor and taste to the sauce. The Fettuccini Alfredo sauce was really good. and father had Spaghetti and Meatballs witch looked good. Honestly I didn't want to mention anything about the show and come on a open mind, witch I think everyone should when eating out and not eating at chains rather then small business witch we should support. We met Amy and Sammy and its nice to see owners actually coming out and greeting guest. I know its hard to especially having owned one ourselves. We went on a Friday small crowd in and out under 1 hr tops. I wish I could say that we had the same experience at Gordon's. However I highly recommend checking out this place and giving it a chance. Try on slow time during weekend trade, depending on how fast you need to be in and out weather catching a show at the movies or shopping locally. We all need to support small business owners. I know Arizona Restaurant Week is coming at least make a attempt to check it out.. ! Thanks for the great meal Amy and Sammy"
2014-05-17,TcJvptOC56hZZGwWM9QSZA,"Horrible, absolutely horrible.  I came here for dinner.  Not crowded which was good but food took forever to be served and it was cold.  Terrible customer service.  I will not return."
2011-12-02,KR4lqutJN194cvGoBL0JHg,Beautiful restaurant in a strip mall. Very friendly.  Excellent pizza!  We will be back to try the rest of the menu!
2014-09-15,XHwjG5eRaTudtRSLwCoEWw,"Underwhelming experience to say the least.  Slow service, and the food wasn't all that great for the price.  The one saving grace was the desert...AMAZING.  Wait staff was ok..seemed a bit overwhelmed though"
2013-07-10,l6kngM5F-IMNtZX5fb-uOA,"I flew in Scottsdale for a job interview and yes, had to try it out. I love Gordon Ramsey and these people should have listened. I really just blame Amy. I ordered a very simple sausage and pepperoni pizza and 4 inches around from the center of the pizza was soggy. It was weird. I didn't eat much. And I was hoping one of the owners would yell at a patron, that's probably the main reason why I went. Sure enough, there was some arguing. I didn't hear exactly what they said, but the customer was showed the door. It was good entertainment. 1 star for that.Curiosity killed the cat; never again!"
2014-05-19,lm67K_Vv8sMRo04vEPO-4Q,"Made the horrible mistake to give this ""restaurant"" a chance. BAD food. Frozen and not fresh. Argumentative and rude was the response when we made the mistake of being honest. This place needs to be shut down. Will NEVER return...ever."
2013-05-09,9Dogp_D0SPZUt1KT18ya2A,"Please do not eat here. I had lunch with a friend; then my husband joined us but we left and he stayed and finished. We had already paid, and told my husband just to pay for his food. They charged him for our food as well, thinking we didn't have the conversation that we had paid! Long story short , after threatening to call the police .....they are ruthless and who knows what they do to your food! Just don't !"
2011-12-16,gHBMX2oTgxcPQr3KKrn3Xg,"another great experience at Amy's Baking Company tonight!this time, i brought my entire family, my boyfriend, and my cousin and all were very pleased and satisfied with the appetizers, entrees, and desserts.samy and his wife have continued to show unparalleled hospitality to us throughout our entire dining experience.we all shared the fig pear prosciutto pizza as an appetizer to go around and it was remarkable. none of us had ever tasted anything like it! when you stop by the bistro, definitely order this as an entree or appetizer for a large group.all the entrees we ordered were also very fulfilling. from the salmon my dad ordered to the various pastas and the chicken parmesan, all very tasty, authentic, and filling!the 2 cheesecakes (vanilla bean and white chocolate cranberry cheesecake) we all shared were also very tasty and rich. as an out of state visitor from los angeles, i can't wait to return here with my family the next time i'm in town for the holidays.do stop by this gem of a restaurant sometime soon!thanks, samy and amy, for another exceptional dining experience. it was all scrumptious!"
2014-11-06,973_72jy8C3yYyLFlnUIIQ,"My friend and I visited Amy and Sammy's wonderful restaurant while we were in town visiting from Vegas. We wanted to see if all the TV drama was true from Gordon Ramsey's show. Well I will tell you every single item out of that kitchen was delicious! Sammy was also very attentive and friendly making sure we were satisfied and comfortable. They truly are a lovely couple. We even went back recently after visiting again and brought our parents. Again another delicious hit! Please don't buy into the TV drama, go to this restaurant!! WE LOVE IT and I wish I could order Amys baked goods online!"
2013-05-09,9bp6P6kSrS_p46vcyc5zww,"The food here is really sub-par, don't come here for a good meal. You should however come here for the entertainment. The owners are literally insane, it's fun to watch them go crazy yelling at people (they make terrible food, people complain, then the owners yell at the customers)."
2010-08-06,9sSmag2w-ICemEDSGN4Emg,"Not impressed at all with the pizza here. I thought it was dry and flavorless.Additionally, after reading about the owner harassing a Yelping for his honest opinions about the joint, I can confidently say that I will not be returning here.UPDATE: The owner of AMC has been messaging me to prove that I did in fact eat there. When I couldn't provide an exact date (it was nearly a year ago) he insisted I was lying about being there and contacted Yelp HQ. He said I needed to either provide a receipt or I needed to remove my review. Luckily, Yelp doesn't agree with his statement. Just accept I didn't like your pizza or your customer service. It's okay, there are 6 billion people on this planet. Not everyone is going to like your pizza."
2011-05-29,Yc83TtvpYVl8HOadAUfUJg,"Visited this place on Friday night at 10:05 p.m. We were pleased to see ABC Bistro stayed open until11:00 p.m. and decided to go for it. We enter and Samy says to sit in the patio. We asked to stay inside and he said no, on the patio, because we have to clean up for tomorrow.  That should have been a sign, but we stayed. He offered to turn the misters on but never did.THE GOOD:For $12, the Salmon burger and honey citrus salad were really excellent. The bun was surprisingly good, and the dressing on the salad was among the very best I've ever tried. The burger was more of a fried salmon croquette, which was unexpected because I don't like fried food too much and did not think I was ordering a fried dish, but it also was good.The restroom was impeccable, and the restaurant inside was tastefully decorated and scrupulously clean. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to sit inside...THE BAD: Soft drinks are $3.50 and refills were not forthcoming. Yes, I know it's about a dollar more per drink than is customary in similar establishments, but for some reason it bugged me, maybe because it was hot on the patio.For $12, you get 10 gnocchi swimming in a half a quart of marinara with a generous amount of oil slicking the top of it. If you wish to add more parmesan than the minuscule amount that comes with it, be prepared to pay extra. When is the last time you paid extra for parmesan cheese in a restaurant? The vast amount of sauce and small portion of gnocchi was really puzzling. The marinara itself was a bit acidic and somewhat bitter. Other reviewers also mentioned that the sauce is generous and the portions less so, and that was our experience as well. After having finished all the gnocchi, about 10 ounces of sauce were left on the soup plate. Interestingly, no bread was offered, which is surprising for a bread company.Around 10:15 the ugly bright lights come on inside and light up the patio, killing the mood. The waitresses start pulling up all the tablecloths outside, leaving us surrounded by naked plastic tables.The waitresses and Samy were busy cleaning and we were the only table left in the restaurant. After waiting for some time alone on the patio, we knocked on the glass to get their attention.We asked for our check, paid and left. We would have offered constructive criticism, but thought we'd cut our losses and leave. I would not return, mainly because of the attitude, the fact that parmesan and bread costs extra, and the wrecking of the mood with the cleanup and bright lights. I can overlook a dish I didn't enjoy, but not this attitude where the last two customers are an inconvenience."
2015-07-25,OewmkZoJVOXMTSgzzPtOUQ,"I've seen the KN show, I've heard the hype, and I have read the reviews. Before I get into my personal review, I've just got to say how distasteful and extremely childish it is for people from other states and countries to write bad reviews SOLELY based on a tv show. If you have not physically gone to ABC, then you don't get to write about it. Anyways... my husband and I just left Amy's about 15 minutes ago. We came in to grab a dessert to go. We walked in and Sammi was at the counter. He was so kind, and very personable. We had a bit of a chit chat, and when I picked out a dessert (tiramisu) he replaced it with another one because it had fallen over on one side. It wasn't a necessary replacement, but it was such a kind gesture. He also made a point to use my husband's name, which again, is just such a great small gesture. I saw Amy briefly, and she honestly is just... so gorgeous. I got nervous and didn't say anything but I guess I can take the time to tell her now: the tiramisu is delicious!!! This was a good experience. We just moved here from out of state and I live less than 4 miles away from ABC. I'm very sad that it will be closing."
2014-11-10,ALe3r6uUON83DMnubzt7Og,"this place is revolting... the pizza tasted like greasy cafeteria food and the pastry my wife tried was so dry it was completely inedible.. we then sent them both back and not only were berated by the owner, but his wife decided to join in this melee as well tossing around insults like little children unable to control their anger.  Understandably we will never return simply because of the horrible food."
2013-07-06,AXBqF5hGDrrISYGuVBskUQ,"By now we've all seen or heard of Gordon Ramsay's ""Kitchen Nightmares""- first in 10 seasons he actually had to walk out on. Putting that aside - as much as a GR fan can do, and with an open mind, I decided to give them a try. From the moment I entered, the ice-princess Amy greeted me from behind the counter,  Samy alongside, with all the warmth of a polar ice cap. I was seated at a table by the window and felt watched every moment. Because I was. I witnessed a forced-controlled Samy demean and dress down his servers- constantly. I got a pastry that neither of 2 servers could tell me if it was a cake or tart- (Coconut/white chocolate) and a ""European"" (read: tiny) coffee. The tart, or pie, as it was, underneath a mountain of whipped topping was supposed to be white chocolate. It was curdled and had zero flavor. The graham cracker crust was not as good as a store bought version, very pedestrian. It basically had no flavor, and appeared to be at least 3 days old. I had one bite, took the rest home, and threw it in the garbage. The coffee- what there was of it- very good. The atmosphere- tense and stressful. The bill? over $15.00. I will never, I mean NE-VER return. RIP, ABC!"
2014-06-25,npsvJP7IU8naAYzBy_G6zA,Honestly the desserts were all we tried but they were to die for and I have been craving the key lime pie and coconut cream cake since my visit last week. Amy was super sweet and had a great talk with my little one. Update-just saw the show for the first time so don't hold it against me. I went in open and the dessert was good.
2013-08-21,BbSWL3PjQBzY7uDWaqlXqg,"This restaurant is horrible. First off the blue ribbon burger was soggy and all over the place! It was literally dripping and ruining my fries. It probably the worst burger of ALL TIME. Then the pizza was ridiculously undercooked. The dough wash actually raw!!! The only saving grace was the desserts which seemed to be expertly prepared. No way were they prepared by the same chef.Sammy seemed to be in a terrible mood!  To be honest if I was married to that lady and had to eat that food daily, I'd probably be in a bad mood as well.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! MCDONALD'S IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE."
2011-09-26,souE1foAZ95QFlWn9zYB1w,"Absolute most amazing hidden jewel of a restaurant.  I dine out often and would highly recommend this restaurant.  Not anything ordinary here.  The desserts are unmatched and the owners are absolutely the most sincere hard working, passionate, wonderful people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting!  Amy makes all of her creations from scratch, by hand and it shows in the presentation and flavors of everything she masters.  Seriously, this place is not to be mistaken for the average...not by a long shot!!!  Treat yourself...save room for dessert...thank me later!!!"
2011-07-06,QygKt3so1FBlt9cozCb4-g,"I rarely, if ever, write reviews; however, this is pretty shocking. I actually found this review trying to find a number for Amy's so that I can order dinner, and was shocked by what I read.  I live within walking distance of Amy's but only tried it for the first time with a friend a couple of months ago.  When walking past it occasionally while walking my pooch it always appeared to be fairly empty, which is typically a bad sign for a restaurant.  Despite the seemingly frightening availability of seats my friend and I decided to give Amy's a chance and we were pleasantly surprised - the food and service were great. In fact, the pizza was the some of the best I've had since moving here and that is saying a lot as I am from Chicago and relocated to the area from Brooklyn, where I lived for 2 years.  By no means am I an expert, but I've had my fair share of delicious pizza!  I thought that the gentleman who served us was very polite and accommodating as he rushed our order knowing that we were attempting to grab dinner before a movie. I came in again for the pizza a month later and he remembered me and apologized in advance for the delay because he was short-staffed and attending to a fairly large party. I was still able to get my pizza to go without any issues and I was even offered a free appetizer due to the wait; although, I did not wait for that long. So my service experience has clearly been different.  I've also never tried going there for dinner at 10 PM as I didn't even know there were restaurants (non-chain at least) in Scottsdale opened that late any night of the week lol.I've had a few items off the menu - the caramelized onion and fig pizza (my favorite item), the crostinis (they are offered with a couple of different toppings), the appetizer of french fries, the monte cristo, and the martini with pomegranate juice. I can't think of a single complaint on any of the dishes that I've tried.I will say that well its Scottsdale and I am fairly shocked when I see people whine about prices. You can go across the street to Dickie's and spend $15 on the world's worse bbq, so I think $14 for a reasonably sized pizza really isn't that bad. Even at Pita Jungle you'll be hard-pressed to spend less than $10 on a pita and side item whereas in most mom-and-pop Greek ""dives"" in Chicago I can get a d!%# good gyros with hand cut fries for about $6. I'll also acknowledge that the owner's response to criticism was unprofessional. I can understand that criticism, even when constructive, can be hard to take but it has become a part of the business.  Customers no longer just go home unsatisfied; they go home and blog about their unsatisfactory experience.In short, I will still head to Amy's and enjoy my pizza dinner, while most likely walking on egg shells to avoid making anyone angry lol. I'd recommend giving the place a shot (at the very least try the pizza with caramelized onions, prosciutto and figs!) and forming an opinion of your own despite the reviews. You might be pleasantly surprised!"
2014-02-28,hNGyfdR7JU5h7yhhox_9_g,"Would give 0 stars if I could.  Owners are extremely rude.  My burger was as wet as a soaked sponge tried to send it back and old man said I was wrong and when he got to the kitchen the crazy lady that calls herself a chef said I don't know what good food is.  Do not eat here, I have never seen such chaos in a restaraunt.  Server girl was nice but left a cash tip and watched old man put the tip in his pocket what kind of owner steals from their people. Wow unbelievable.  Please close your doors"
2015-03-15,XBU6n9PNHclUUMrAwNLXcg,My friends and I drove up from Tucson to try this place out and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! We went in to get dessert to go right before they closed but the husband agreed to let us dine in and they stayed open a bit longer than normal. We ordered the creme brulee and the coconut cake and both where delicious the creme brulee was amazing! The best that I have ever had and the cake was okay it was good but not totally our thing. Amy brought us out free cheesecake brownies because she loved my boyfriend's cat T-shirt. They where both very sweet to us and made it a point to make sure we where happy with our food. I definitely plan on going back to try their dinner menu I hope it's as good as this was!
2013-11-20,DF7cA_HEDnEUNxy5fdtSbg,Pizza was horrible!! Creme brulee saved the day though.. They really should focus on a deserts only.
2015-02-21,MW7MU8qIXcgKM7N2MFYpJw,"Ate here this fall when I was visiting the area. Of course I came because of the show, but I wanted to try things for myself. Smaller menu than what was in the show and only Amy working the kitchen this change must have been the right move for them because everything I ate, including the desert was phenomenal. I went back multiple times in the week and a half I was in Scottsdale. Also, Amy and Samy are two of the nicest people I have ever met. What most people do not understand is that they were approached by the kitchen nightmare casting group multiple times. They did not call the show for help. I can understand why Amy was defensive in the TV show; yes, her and her husband are eccentric, but they are passionate and Amy has a true talent. I encourage everybody to try the place for themselves before passing judgment."
2014-08-02,OrCQLkJcxLOOZsGGFQjMkA,"Gross gross gross, omg mold on the cheesecake and try to argue with me that it's the leaf of the raspberry, ummmmm no there was mold all over the raspberries and still charged us.. Rude and horrible!!!! No go!!"
2014-07-09,HJcefmRMibsdnRGC98Y19A,"Today I decided to visit Amy's Baking Co for lunch, and am I glad I did! First I ordered the hummus and flatbread. It was even better than what I expected. The flatbread was incredible. Freshly baked and warm, and the hummus was authentic. Then I decided to try the pizza. I ordered the garlic chicken mushroom. I have to say, I have not had pizza this good on the west coast. The crust was thin and unique ( used also for the flatbread). I was truly impressed. I became aware of this place from the Gordon Ramsey episode. I have to say, Samy and Amy are two passionate and customer service oriented owners. They take great pride in their work, and if you live in Scottsdale shame on you if this place is not one of your regular stops. Thanks for a wonderful experience and I look forward to my next trip to AZ , as I'll be back for dinner!"
2014-04-12,HRvZS41gIwfK_d9Q-GvPTg,"My wife and I went there with no prejudices of watching TV or the local news, and the food was very good and the desserts obviously were great.After watching Kitchen Nightmares it would seem there issues there but I didn't  see anything worth bashing them."
2014-04-12,Ld9X5J6bBKfQZBfuDDXOQA,"Had the ""Blue Ribbon Burger"" and fries. Burger was absolutely disgusting and DRENCHED in grease. So much grease in fact that the grease pool it created filled my plate and drenched my fries. So with the gross burger and gross burger soaked fries, I WILL NOT be coming back.Lol ""permanently closed"" GOOD!!!"
2014-07-11,nHGTr9F_NmxLQPDceuAu1A,"The food is rubbish.  I had a ""salmon burger""---looked and tasted like a hockey puck.  Loved the store-bought dessert."
2013-07-11,OXlyEKhXNOnL4kAzmuWbkw,"I was surprised by how much I liked it. I watched Kitchen Nightmares, so I had to check it out. I was waiting for the shit show to start!! There were only 2 tables that were eating. The servers were very attentive and picked up straw trash and sugar packets, refilled drinks. They were almost too nice, but I'd take that over being ignored. We had the flatbread and hummus. Flatbread tasted like naan bread and was good. Roasted red hummus was average. Eggplant parm was perfectly fried and full of flavor. The pesto was ok, just needed salt and pepper. The desserts were absolutely beautiful.  I tried to talk to Amy, but she seemed annoyed.  We ordered cheesecake and white coconut tart, and a pepperoni, sausage, pesto pizza to go. Sammy asked how our food was as we left, and he was quite friendly. Damn, I didn't get yelled at! I really was expecting fireworks, but am pleasantly surprised on how good the food was. I re-heated the pizza at home. Thin, very, flavorful crust, toppings were generous: large pepperoni slices, not the little packaged kind. The center of the pizza seemed a bit doughy, but it was still really good.  I honestly think it was one of the top 5 pizzas I've had in my life. Wish I could've hated this place! Lol. I really do hope that they can start getting more customers, and I don't think people should post who haven't even tried the food.  And I can't believe how nice I'm being. Rawr."
2011-11-21,N8R0JzHfkQuM8bY8ppBPPg,"The food is not as terrible as people have made it sound, nor is it as great as others. What made my experience bad was the constant talk about this whole yelp thing. I don't want to hear about this while I'm in your restaurant. Kudos on the Creme Brulee, thoroughly enjoyed it!"
2011-08-31,Nh8oBY8HFsNkUAUFhRU21w,I've thrown up better pizza. This pizza is just bland and awful and should not be sold to anyone who is currently not in prison.
2012-08-29,_9u7QDI0FDfPDnHbiWFPRw,I visited Amy's for the first time last Friday night before a movie and was very pleased with both the food and service.   We shared the spinach salad and the pulled pork pizza.  Both were excellent and we especially enjoyed the pizza.   The young man that waited on us was really helpful and pleasant.  I will definitely go back.
2014-04-21,RdGABVIkf3mnwtx04fWlWw,"Truly disgusting!! Watching Kitchen Nightmares reminded me to write my experience with ABC last year around October. I was visiting AZ on a business trip and went into this place not having heard anything about it before. The place looked fantastic and the host/owner seemed friendly at first. The waitress was nice too, and warned us about possibly having to wait for our food even though the place was practically empty. My pasta came in almost an hour later while my mate's food was nowhere to be found. I'll be honest my pasta tasted fine..nothing special but it was decent. My friend's meal comes in well after an hour and a half and it was apparently cold and peppery. When he tried to send it back, the owner came to enquire about the issue and took it back. At this point we didn't wanna wait another hour for his food and wanted to leave and then things got ugly. The owner demanded we pay for the food we returned or wait and when we refused he was rude and obnoxious. After a bit of back and forth we got our way but not before they said we weren't welcome back in their restaurant. After watching the episode I feel like we actually got treated quite well compared to their other customers and I wouldn't go back there even if their food was brilliant."
2018-07-04,SrjOPkiuTMkuExwH6zgmXg,They were all so rude and I can't believe how physcopath the owners were. They yelled at all the customers and I can't believe my waiter didn't receive the tip I left for her. Also they fired multiple while I WAS EATING MY DINNER. Multiple in a short period of time. These people should be arrested
2014-08-22,hYNjoYriyFH-uQTwDmczzA,I've been to Amy's twice now.  I admit...I first went to see the train wreck.  Both times I have been pleasantly surprised.  The last time I shared a piece of Key Lime Pie with a friend and it was absolutely amazing!  Both Samy and Amy were there and were very friendly.  Next time I am down to see a movie we will go for dinner!
2014-05-09,TU0LXPVbHIoSzn9ZTVU2gA,"Yuck! We just moved to the area and were looking for new restaurants, this place was a mistake. Hummus had a very strange texture, and despite being called cilantro hummus, there was no flavor.My husband had the blue cheese burger, was way too greasy, under cooked, and just tasted off. BBG Chicken Mango pizza, we had with avacado, the avacado was mushy and old. We tried to send the pizza back, but were treated with dis-respect, in a shocking manner. We paid and left, never again."
2014-02-25,sg3QZFaRd7S4-39pQTO3tw,"I went here because it was on Gordon Ramsay's show.My roommate roommate and I are 28 y/o males.I thought the show might be kind of staged... but no. I saw the owner (the guy) be very rude to a costumer wanting a specific kind of cake. It was entertaining and probably made the experience worthwhile The menu did not appeal to either of us. Not much I wanted to eat, but that could just be our style in food.I ordered the burger just like Ramsay did on the show. He was right. It was way too ""juicy"" and the bun fell apart. Gross. It had a bad flavor and the burger ""juice"" was all over the place.I would give a C-. My roommate had a C- meal as well. It was a fun experience, but food could be found better almost anywhere!"
2014-05-14,UeO4L1ohymCBcrX33nbozQ,The Pizza was so horrible. The worst I have ever eaten. Very soggy and undercooked. the dough was raw under the sauce and toppings. The man behind the counter was rude when I explained it was undercooked. told us not to come back if we don't think it was good. I have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store.  I really don't know how you stay in business treating people the way you do.
2013-05-22,Uj4YAf1xoYFLngzKm9-84A,"The much anticipated grand reopening was just as I remember it when I ate there last time,  EXCELLENT! !!!  Nothing goes better with Amy's delicious pasta than all that delicious red wine I consumed while there last night.   I guess people really don't know good food and I can tell you all that Amy's is the place to get great food.   If your going to complain about the price then this place isn't for you.  Thanks once again for the excellent food Amy and Sam.   I'll be back in Sedona in August and plan on coming through again.  A++++"
2014-09-12,UlEF_FU-7EUYd5AloPeC7A,Never again! Never again! Just a bad overall experience. Food was sub par and customer service? Well that just doesn't exist. I wish you guys could turn it around with maybe a better chef because this place has potential.
2013-05-28,WpCdgagrQjdoTUEEPfgGOg,"Was on vacation about about 3 hours away when my friend and I thought we'd make the drive over to check this place out after seeing it on T.V. When we got our food everything seems under cooked and chewy. Nothing there seemed fresh and my friend pointed out that a server was in an argument with some customers about two tables away about them finding a bug in their drink, which was when you could clearly hear one of the owners say ""Well if you don't like it please leave"""
2014-12-29,lSeoD18HiPG1aAwZxtN5Iw,"Total Kitchen Nightmare fan here. My fiancé and I were on a road-trip and Scottsdale just happened to be on the way. We were an hour away from the restaurant. At that time their hours weren't posted on Yelp. I called in to ask what time they closed. Samy answered, ""We will keep the kitchen open for you."" We arrived right when they were closing and we were extremely exhausted and hungry but Samy's warm greeting was so uplifting it just made the whole dining experience soooo much more pleasant. Oh my goodness, the food is AMAZING. I had the spicy pasta rustica, I LOVED THIS DISH!!!! My fiance had the cold chicken penne pasta salad, which he's been trying to re-create ever since we came here but hasn't been able to hahaha!"
2014-04-09,ZkIA_AsRiAh4hbL6vkBPpg,"Bullies eventually go away when you ignore them.I don't live near your restaurant.  If I did I would definitely try it out.  I haven't watched the reality show in question so, prior to today (the Dr. Phil Show) I had never heard of you.I definitely have compassion for you.  I caught from the show that you are Jewish.  Jews are one of the only people groups in the world who have been actively sought out to be eliminated multiple times.  Amy's reaction to the racial slams seems justified.....but not wise.Amy.....my advice to you (if you are even reading which I hope you are not) is to take Dr. Phil's advice and ignore what people say here.  Focus on creating good food and being pleasant with your customers.  THAT is a winning combination!Best wishes from a compassionate friend,Jen"
2013-08-26,bvQe6pWK2kc9kBJh3A77QA,This atmosphere in this restaurant is very uncomfortable and none of us enjoyed our food. I will not be back.
2015-02-07,eJK_6AX7gz_1-n9lyslHqQ,Samy was extremely polite and attentive as our host and waiter. Might come back for a coffee and dessert. nice atmosphere. Beautiful restaurant decor. We had seen kitchen nightmares and was curious about the hype so we decided to try it. Food was average and a little unusual. I never ate pear in a sandwich and never have since. Overall we were expecting a spectacle but it seemed business as usual and uneventful.
2013-06-03,ewVQMzD4PTVadrz_cvDicg,"This place is worse than they showed on TV.  The cook doesn't know how to cook, and the husband runs around like an idiot with his head cut off. The pizza is horrid, the baked items taste like cardboard. I wish I could give -5 stars because this has to be the worst run restaurant in the world. The owners are truly too stupid to live!!! Run away from this quagmire of a restaurant!!!!"
2015-02-19,ga3AekMxRZAdH61IBJccrw,"No food for you! I had never watched Kitchen Nightmares until after this event! I went to Amy's since one of the family members I was visiting insisted we go there since she said they had good food. We walked in, sat down, and they insisted we were yelpers! I do not have cable television in my home and only watch netflix on occasion with my children. I honestly did know what a yelper was until I googled it on my phone after leaving the establishment. They asked us to leave very hatefully saying we were only there to give them a bad review. Since that is what they wanted here it is! We ended up going next door to eat and was happy with the food there.  I could not believe how they treated us! Even if we were ""yelpers"" I would think they would want to show us everything good they had to offer so we would give them a good review."
2014-04-27,he3Bn8QTTW3cQybv9u_xgA,"So I've seen a lot online about how awful it is and I didnt want to believe it. My fiancee had a small hockey tournament in Arizona and I thought of the ""wonderful"" Idea to try it out and see if it was really as awful as the internet and reality TV made it out to be...Well on walking in it was beautiful! Very clean and it smelled great! It was peaceful however thats really where the nice-ness ended. We ordered the 3 cheese pizza and it was very um...wiggly? And not too mention expensive! But I've seen how they react to complaints so my fiancee and I were waaaay to afraid to say anything! D: We witnessed one couple leaving after waiting a very long time for their food and miss Amy herself just waved a hand saying to let them go and miss out because they were crazy...All in all it was a scary experience for everyone."
2014-06-07,hvfmC2jgTwH7jHrRZCVjLg,"The ravioli still tastes frozen. It's overpriced, and for the price I paid, I could buy dozens of cans of Chef Boyardee's ravioli, which taste better than the freezer burnt vomit that Amy served.The appetisers are all riddled with oil. My god, I'm surprised that this restaurant hasn't been invaded by the USA, there's that much oil! The salads also cost a goldmine, and for the ingredients, quality, and overall taste, I'd rather go eat at some fast food chain than eat Amy's ""salads.""The desserts are still store bought, and Amy has somehow made some of them turn waxy and foamy, which I consider to be an amazing accomplishment, as I thought store bought desserts were already at the most disgusting they could be. Apparently I was wrong.Sami and Amy are still both angry and trollish.This place's hours should read Monday-Sunday: CLOSED!"
2013-05-22,jdCiXnF1S-aGAKCR-F7rhw,"My girlfriends grand parents recommended this place, they live right down the street from it.The two of us went there and quite frankly didn't like anything we tried. Her pizza was raw and doughy. My chicken was chewy and tasteless, like it had been freezer burned and reheated.The waiter was rude and not attentive, found out as we were leaving he was actually the husband of the owner; the guy should not be around customers, he's terrible.Later I found out her grandparents only go there for the deserts, not the food. Personally I wouldn't go there at all.When we travel back to AZ for her family, there's better places to go.EDIT: Take a really close look at the 5 star reviews for this place. 99% of them are OBVIOUS fakes. I came back to see if anyone else had anything legitimately good to say about this place that could convince me to try it again and all I am finding are fake 5 star reviews.Note to the owners: If you want to convince people like me to come back and try again; stop posting fake reviews and start making good food. I only trust real peoples opinions and not fake PR campaigns"
2013-06-28,k2cj-tXAGT3AHWOcMvaqvg,I must have caught the guy running the place on a bad day. He didnt want to discuss my displeasure with the food I was served and had no alternative correction for it. I simply paid the bill and left. I guess that is how his trophy wife and he manage the place....Stay away.
2013-05-09,lcnFoFyDk4Q8ZBxScdVflQ,"This place should just stick to baking... all there stuff is beautiful and tasty. However there food is dull and tasteless. The worse part of this place are the owners, just rude and in denial, clearly they have no idea what customer services means. It's a shame they should just stick to the baking which is amazing..."
2014-06-15,r2ndQTKsspgxyOrhURj_eg,"Went in with an open mind, Was very impressed with the food, had the sweet and spicy pasta rustica and My fiance had the gnocchi with basil, she loved it... Sammy was very friendly,  didn't get to meet Amy,  must say it was nothing like what was on kitchen nightmares. They must have changed the menu, If the food was the same when the show was filmed I must say I have a different outlook on Ramsay (huge fan) cause there was nothing wrong with the food. Will be definitely going back, highly recommend"
2015-02-16,tXOL_slmBpDFfxUi4YmhOg,"My mom and I have eaten here at least six times, the food has always been good, service consistent and the deserts out of this world!!!!!!!!"
2016-03-11,uxNIyPAXW9fZyNZuGDmK2g,"The food was...eh.  Not worth the price.  Of all the places we could have eaten while on vacation I would have rather eaten at Taco Bell.  We will NOT recommend this place to anyone and we will NOT eat here ever again.That's the food....as for the gal that served us, she was very nice, very helpful and tried her hardest to give us great service.  So for that we are thankful but when it comes down to it, FOOD was the point and the food just couldn't stand on it's own.The amount of reviews on here praising the food....I don't believe them for one second.  These MUST BE fake reviews.  Shameful!Side note, didn't eat desert.  So if that part of them is good then maybe they should stick to that and quit trying to churn out garbage food."
2013-05-30,x5Zy72sHIMVblbALzsH0Ag,"We had to come in after seeing this place tear apart it's customers online. Our waitress was a sweet lady who was extremely timid. (Coincidence?) We ordered the Fig Pear Prosciutto which looked really good. It came out and edges of the crust were burned black. We informed our waitress and the second we said something she got really nervous. We said never mind it's fine, and she went behind the counter. That's when we heard her manager YELLING at the poor woman. Dude, it is NOT her fault your cook botched our pizza.We ordered a slice of pie and there was a fruit fly sitting on top of it. We didn't eat it, and didn't say anything to our waitress lest she be beaten in front of us.Bad food, bad managers, bad place."
2016-05-05,xgwsA1Z3TjfQsk8lRppiVA,Best pizza in America.I think the owners name was Sammy. This Sammy guy knows his shit. The pizza I give a solid 9.6 out of 10. That's the highest pizza review I have ever given.I wish this place was open because I crave this pizza.
2014-08-01,yEwhexnqgzNfHpuEVKAFXg,"Food taste like shit as well as their customer service. They can't take criticism at all and the owners flip out for the truth. I saw them from kitchen NIGHTMARES from chef Ramsey, let me say it's far worse then a nightmare. I decided to go check it out myself and see if it is actually what the show presented them to be, they're not lying the owner is delusional."
